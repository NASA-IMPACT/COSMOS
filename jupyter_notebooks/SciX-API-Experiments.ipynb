       "    'abstract': 'Space weather events, including active regions on the Sun responsible for significant and potential space weather, have been monitored from Earth and space. However, this coverage does not generally include all longitudes of the Sun at any given time. Serendipitously, images from the Mars rovers show sunspots and can supplement traditional solar imaging. The Perseverance rover on Mars carries the Mastcam-Z stereo camera, which has the potential for monitoring sunspots from a Mars vantage point. Color and monochrome (880-nm) solar images were taken using neutral density filters that allow solar imaging. Images were taken with the primary purpose of monitoring the direct flux at the surface and thus determining the time-variable aerosol load of the atmosphere via extinction. The 67 microradian pixel size corresponds to 15,000 km on the Sun, a very low resolution compared to purpose-built solar cameras. However, it can detect &gt;40% of sunspots and resolve the largest 5-10% of spot umbras. In addition, the Curiosity rover has a nearly 10-year record of 440-nm solar images at a somewhat lower resolution that still detects the largest active areas. We will present a catalog of the sunspot record as observed from Mars. We shall also discuss the following: <P />Dates for which another asset can validate the observations;Times for which Mars had a unique vantage and thus provide data that might be useful for localizing space weather events or validating models of farside activity (e.g., from helioseismology);Prospects for future monitoring of regions of the Sun that are about to become Earth-facing when Mars has a unique vantage (e.g., several months during 2023 and 2025).',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Each Mars Exploration Rover carries an integrated suite of scientific instruments and tools called the Athena science payload. The primary objective of the Athena science investigation is to explore two sites on the Martian surface where water may once have been present, and to assess past environmental conditions at those sites and their suitability for life. The remote sensing portion of the payload uses a mast called the Pancam Mast Assembly (PMA) that provides pointing for two instruments: the Panoramic Camera (Pancam), and the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES). Pancam provides high-resolution, color, stereo imaging, while Mini-TES provides spectral cubes at mid-infrared wavelengths. For in-situ study, a five degree-of-freedom arm called the Instrument Deployment Device (IDD) carries four more tools: a Microscopic Imager (MI) for close-up imaging, an Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) for elemental chemistry, a Mössbauer Spectrometer (MB) for the mineralogy of Fe-bearing materials, and a Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) for removing dusty and weathered surfaces and exposing fresh rock underneath. The payload also includes magnets that allow the instruments to study the composition of magnetic Martian materials. All of the Athena instruments have undergone extensive calibration, both individually and using a set of geologic reference materials that are being measured with all the instruments. Using a MER-like rover and payload in a number of field settings, we have devised operations processes that will enable us to use the MER rovers to formulate and test scientific hypotheses concerning past environmental conditions and habitability at the landing sites.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Future space exploration requires close study of extraterrestrial bodies such as Mars. The Mars micro-rover proposal was configured to closely meet the requirements of scientists and budget criteria. Due to the hostility of the Martian environment a reliable mobility system must be integrated to the rover concept. This project demonstrates the feasibility of such a design drawing on current data. The design was governed by the operational lifespan of the vehicle, a period of one Martian year at latitude of 30 degrees. The project provides a step-by-step simulation of the rover's mobility system design. Furthermore the design provides and integrates all vital sub-systems required for successful operation of the Mars rover. A primary consideration during the design process of the rover was ease of integration with an array of different payloads. Potential payloads are constrained by the mass of 1067 g., space availability of 110 by 100 by 45 mm and the availability of power 85.4 W. Although only a conceptual design, this report summarises of all required design parameters for future rover development.<BR /><BR />Today Mars exploration is one of the most popular areas of research. Different methodologies are implemented accord- ingly to various mission requirements. Observation satellite use can give wide area cover, while surface landing probes give accurate details. Mobile vehicles allow achieving both, how- ever at a cost to pay. The mission that involves mobile rover is extremely costly and requires high reliability.<BR /><BR />The use of small size rovers will allow minimising expenditure on a project. The design of the multi-purpose rover with possibility to use different payloads will give higher mission safety. This will be achieved by utilisation of the same structure bus.<BR /><BR />This project will present preliminary studies for the concep- tual design of Mars micro rover mobility system. Furthermore, it will summarise the steps required for the rover sub-system architecture. It is proposed that the successful mobility system is the rover design with all required sub-systems to enable onboard payload to operate safely. The report also gives de- scription of the design process itself and aims to be a guide for a future research work.<BR /><BR />In general the report will present micro rover design as the answer to the Mars mobility system design problem.

Two identical tri-axial fluxgate magnetometer sensors are mounted at the top and bottom of the mast of rover, respectively. The technology of Helmholtz compensation coil probe and digital closed-loop feedback circuit is utilized to realize high precision measurement. Each magnetometer measures the vector magnetic field with a resolution of 0.01 nT in the range of ±65000 nT. The sample rate is up to 32 Hz and the noise is 0.01 nT/√Hz @1 Hz. A rover magnetic compensation procedure was conducted to remove the most important magnetic disturbances. Mobile magnetic field measurements on the Martian surface would obtain fine-scale crust field and provide information about its remnant magnetization and any possible intrinsic magnetic field. It would help us to further understand Martian internal structure, coupling processes of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere.',\n",

Combining the techniques of active LIBS, passive SWIR and micro-imaging, MarSCoDe provides functions including elemental composition discrimination and quantitative determination, classification of rock and soil characteristics, sample texture imaging and characterization of plasma-excited area. This paper introduces MarSCoDe mainly in terms of scientific objectives, design requirements, assembly and implementation, spectral and radiation calibration, and performance verification. The LIBS laser irradiance on the target can soundly exceed 10 MW/mm<SUP>2</SUP>, and the performance of the LIBS module operated at different temperatures has been tested. The field of view of the SWIR spectrometer is 36.5 mrad. The micro-imager can extract the central pixel area of 320 × 320 and 1024 × 1024, and the former is binned into 64 × 64. The 2D pointing mirror has a wide forward detection range and a narrow backward calibration range, with the pointing pitch accuracy better than 0.133°.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The wheel tracks left by the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity are unique artificial markings on the surface of Mars. The tracks stretch several kilometers across diverse terrain in two widely separated regions of the planet. The initial appearance and characteristics of the tracks were well documented by the science and navigation cameras aboard the vehicles at the time the tracks were formed. Orbital observations by Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter document the erasure of the tracks over a period of more than 2 Mars years. Close-up examinations of track crossings, where the rovers encountered tracks made hundreds of Martian solar days earlier, provide insights into the mechanisms and time scales of eolian alteration on Mars. These observations suggest that fallout of atmospheric dust plays only a minor role in obscuring rover tracks over time. Instead, track erasure is dominated by sediment that is transported by surface winds. Both deposition and erosion act to erase the rover tracks. The length scales for eolian sediment transport are hundreds of meters at least, much larger than the size of the tracks. Gradual processes such as dust devils and sand saltation have minor effects that can nonetheless erase rover tracks over long time periods. However, short-lived strong wind events associated with seasonal dust storms have much more pronounced effects, significantly altering the tracks on time scales of days. These episodic strong winds tend to occur annually during the perihelion season. The time scale for track erasure is typically only 1 Martian year.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"A Mars rover prototype vehicle named Rocky 4 was designed and built at JPL during the fall of 1991 and spring 1992. This vehicle is the fourth in a series of rovers designed to test vehicle mobility and navigation software. Rocky 4 was the first attempt to design a vehicle with 'flight like' mass and functionality. It was consequently necessary to develop highly efficient mechanisms and structures to meet the vehicles very tight mass limit of 3 Kg for the entire mobility system (7 Kg for the full system). This paper will discuss the key mechanisms developed for the rover's innovative drive and suspension system. These are the wheel drive and strut assembly, the rocker-bogie suspension mechanism and the differential pivot. The end-to-end design, analysis, fabrication and testing of these components will also be discussed as will their performance during field testing. The lessons learned from Rocky 4 are already proving invaluable for the design of Rocky 6. Rocky 6 is currently being designed to fly on NASA's MESUR mission to Mars scheduled to launch in 1996.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The process of identifying the landing site for NASA's Mars 2020 rover began in 2013 by defining threshold mission science criteria related to seeking signs of ancient habitable conditions, searching for biosignatures of past microbial life, assembling a returnable cache of samples for possible future return to Earth, and collecting data for planning eventual human missions to the surface of Mars. Mission engineering constraints on elevation and latitude were used to identify candidate landing sites that addressed the scientific objectives of the mission. However, for the first time these constraints did not have a major influence on the viability of candidate sites and, with the new entry, descent, and landing capabilities included in the baseline mission, the vast majority of sites were evaluated and down-selected on the basis of science merit. More than 30 candidate sites with likely acceptable surface and atmospheric conditions were considered at a series of open workshops in the years leading up to the launch. During that period, iteration between engineering constraints and the evolving relative science potential of candidate sites led to the identification of three final candidate sites: Jezero crater (18.4386°N, 77.5031°E), northeast (NE) Syrtis (17.8899°N,77.1599°E) and Columbia Hills (14.5478°S, 175.6255°E). The final landing site will be selected by NASA's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate. This paper serves as a record of landing site selection activities related primarily to science, an inventory of the number and variety of sites proposed, and a summary of the science potential of the highest-ranking sites.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Dust in the Martian atmosphere influences energy deposition, dynamics, and the viability of solar-powered exploration vehicles. The Viking, Pathfinder, Spirit, Opportunity, Phoenix, Curiosity, and Perseverance landers and rovers each included the ability to image the Sun with a science camera equipped with a neutral density filter. Direct images of the Sun not only provide the ability to measure extinction by dust and ice in the atmosphere, but also provide a variety of constraints on the Martian dust and water cycles. These observations have been used to characterize dust storms, provide ground truth sites for orbiter-based global measurements of dust loading, and help monitor solar panel performance. In the cost-constrained environment of Mars exploration, future missions may omit such cameras, as the solar-powered InSight mission did. <P />We seek to provide a robust capability of determining atmospheric optical depth from sky images taken with cameras that have not been designed for solar imaging, such as the engineering cameras onboard Opportunity or the InSight cameras. Our investigation focuses primarily on the accuracy of a method that determines optical depth values using a scattering model that implements the ratio of sky radiance measurements at different elevation angles, but the same scattering angle. MER engineering cameras are used to obtain non-solar sky images approximately 90° away from a low horizon Sun. A discrete ordinate radiative transfer algorithm and robust atmospheric scattering model are used in conjunction with the downlinked image files to produce both an image and model radiance profile. Optical depth is derived using a least-squares curving fitting routine within a scattering model that iteratively compares the two radiance profiles. Derived optical depth values are then compared against observed Pancam measurements to assess goodness of fit. <P />Operational use requires the ability to retrieve optical depth on a timescale useful to mission planning, and with an accuracy and precision sufficient to support both mission planning and validation of orbital measurements. We present a simulation-based assessment of an imaging strategy and its error budget, as well as a validation based on the comparison of direct extinction measurements from archival Navigation camera (Navcam) data. A preliminary validation using synthetic sky images was performed to test the robustness of the scattering model. Results from this preliminary validation are followed by observational results along with an in-depth error analysis. We conclude with a brief discussion regarding the implications of this study and what the future holds for ground-based optical depth retrieval.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) investigation will use a 2-megapixel color camera with a focusable macro lens aboard the rover, Curiosity, to investigate the stratigraphy and grain-scale texture, structure, mineralogy, and morphology of geologic materials in northwestern Gale crater. Of particular interest is the stratigraphic record of a ∼5 km thick layered rock sequence exposed on the slopes of Aeolis Mons (also known as Mount Sharp). The instrument consists of three parts, a camera head mounted on the turret at the end of a robotic arm, an electronics and data storage assembly located inside the rover body, and a calibration target mounted on the robotic arm shoulder azimuth actuator housing. MAHLI can acquire in-focus images at working distances from ∼2.1 cm to infinity. At the minimum working distance, image pixel scale is ∼14 μm per pixel and very coarse silt grains can be resolved. At the working distance of the Mars Exploration Rover Microscopic Imager cameras aboard Spirit and Opportunity, MAHLI's resolution is comparable at ∼30 μm per pixel. Onboard capabilities include autofocus, auto-exposure, sub-framing, video imaging, Bayer pattern color interpolation, lossy and lossless compression, focus merging of up to 8 focus stack images, white light and longwave ultraviolet (365 nm) illumination of nearby subjects, and 8 gigabytes of non-volatile memory data storage.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Humans have used robotic surrogates to explore Marss geology since 1997, when the Sojourner rover crawled the length of a football field on the red planets surface. But while the robots weve sent to Mars have grown more sophisticated over time, one question in particular lingers: would rover-collected and human-collected data from the same rocks lead us to the same conclusions?Remote Investigations of the Red PlanetThe Mars rovers have advanced our understanding of Marss current geology and past history, including providing evidence that our neighboring planet once had persistent liquid water on its surface. But while the Mars rovers have extended geologists reach by millions of miles, robotic rovers and human geologists are not the same: a rovers resources are exceedingly scarce, requiring teams of scientists on Earth to plan its observations carefully, while a human team can operate more flexibly and make decisions on the fly.Its possible that the inherent limitations of rover data affect the conclusions that scientists on Earth draw from those data. Since we cant (yet) send human geologists to Mars to compare their observations to those made by the Mars rovers, scientists got creative and instead used human rovers on Earth to learn more about this issue.Thinking Like a RoverAerial view of the field site in Iceland, acquired with a drone to mimic orbital data. [Yingst et al. 2022]Aileen Yingst (Planetary Science Institute) and collaborators traveled to Tjrnes peninsula in Iceland to study a 60-meter-high rock outcropping that could serve as an analogue for the layered rocks seen in Jezero crater on Mars, which the Perseverance rover is currently exploring. The rocks in Jezero crater, similar to those on the Tjrnes peninsula, likely contain layers of volcanic and sedimentary materials.Yingst and coauthors asked a human team and a rover team to investigate the rock outcropping using commercial instruments with similar resolution to those on the Mars rover. The human team used standard field techniques to study the outcropping while the rover team studied the rocks remotely, directing just two team members to act as the rover and take measurements based on the instructions of team members who were not at the field site. Both teams planned their investigations using aerial photographs of the region, similar to how rover missions use images from orbiting spacecraft for reconnaissance.Images collected by the rover team. Click to enlarge. [Yingst et al. 2022]Notes for the FutureYingst and collaborators found that the rover team was typically able to determine if materials were volcanic or sedimentary, but the human team made more accurate and more detailed assessments, and they were able to place the materials in context. This may have been because the human team was able to trace rock layers horizontally and make observations from various distances, which allowed them to determine if certain features were continuous between regions as well as determine the scale of the features.The authors noted that the ability to make observations from different distances or angles was crucial to the traditional field teams success. This finding might prompt future Mars rover investigations to allocate more time to collecting images at certain resolutions, if those images might hold the key to correct identifications.CitationUsing Rover-analogous Methodology to Discriminate Between Volcanic and Sedimentary Origins in Successions Dominated by Igneous Composition, R.

       "    'abstract': \"China's Mars rover, Zhurong, touched down on Utopia Planitia in the northern lowlands of Mars (109.925° E, 25.066° N) in May 2021, and has been conducting in situ investigations of the landing area in conjunction with the Tianwen-1 orbiter. Here we present surface properties derived from the Zhurong rover's traverse during the first 60 sols of rover operations. Our analysis of the rover's position from locomotion data and camera imagery over that time shows that the rover traversed 450.9 m southwards over a flat surface with mild wheel slippage. Soil parameters determined by terramechanics, which observes wheel-terrain interactions, indicate that the topsoil has high bearing strength and cohesion. The soil's equivalent stiffness is estimated to range from 1,390 to 5,872 kPa per m<SUP>N</SUP>, and the internal friction angle ranges from 21° to 34° under a cohesion of 1.5 to 6 kPa. Aeolian bedforms in the area are primarily transverse aeolian ridges, indicating northeastern local wind directions. Surface rocks imaged by the rover cameras show evidence of physical weathering processes, such as wind erosion, and potential chemical weathering processes. Joint investigations utilizing the scientific payloads of the rover and the orbiter can provide insights into local aeolian and aqueous history, and the habitability evolution of the northern lowlands on Mars.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Opportunity has been traversing the Meridiani plains since 25 January 2004 (sol 1), acquiring numerous observations of the atmosphere, soils, and rocks. This paper provides an overview of key discoveries between sols 511 and 2300, complementing earlier papers covering results from the initial phases of the mission. Key new results include (1) atmospheric argon measurements that demonstrate the importance of atmospheric transport to and from the winter carbon dioxide polar ice caps; (2) observations showing that aeolian ripples covering the plains were generated by easterly winds during an epoch with enhanced Hadley cell circulation; (3) the discovery and characterization of cobbles and boulders that include iron and stony-iron meteorites and Martian impact ejecta; (4) measurements of wall rock strata within Erebus and Victoria craters that provide compelling evidence of formation by aeolian sand deposition, with local reworking within ephemeral lakes; (5) determination that the stratigraphy exposed in the walls of Victoria and Endurance craters show an enrichment of chlorine and depletion of magnesium and sulfur with increasing depth. This result implies that regional-scale aqueous alteration took place before formation of these craters. Most recently, Opportunity has been traversing toward the ancient Endeavour crater. Orbital data show that clay minerals are exposed on its rim. Hydrated sulfate minerals are exposed in plains rocks adjacent to the rim, unlike the surfaces of plains outcrops observed thus far by Opportunity. With continued mechanical health, Opportunity will reach terrains on and around Endeavour's rim that will be markedly different from anything examined to date.\",\n",

The third winter campaign took advantage of parking on the northern slope of Home Plate to tilt the vehicle to track the sun and thus survive the winter season. With the onset of the spring season, Spirit began circumnavigating Home Plate on the way to volcanic constructs located to the south. Silica-rich nodular rocks were discovered in the valley to the north of Home Plate. The inoperative right front wheel drive actuator made climbing soil-covered slopes problematical and led to high slip conditions and extensive excavation of subsurface soils. This situation led to embedding of Spirit on the side of a shallow, 8 m wide crater in Troy, located in the valley to the west of Home Plate. Examination of the materials exposed during embedding showed that Spirit broke through a thin sulfate-rich soil crust and became embedded in an underlying mix of sulfate and basaltic sands. The nature of the crust is consistent with dissolution and precipitation in the presence of soil water within a few centimeters of the surface. The observation that sulfate-rich deposits in Troy and elsewhere in the Columbia Hills are just beneath the surface implies that these processes have operated on a continuing basis on Mars as landforms have been shaped by erosion and deposition.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'High-accuracy, autonomous and reliable navigation systems are important foundations for Mars rovers to achieve exploration missions successfully. Based on the motion characteristics and working environment of the rover, the paper shows a high-accuracy strapdown inertial navigation system/visual navigation system/celestial navigation system (SINS/VNS/CNS) integrated navigation scheme suitable for the rover with long-time and long-distance motion. According to the feature point positions in the camera frame at adjacent time obtained by the binocular visual odometry, its velocity in the camera frame and the attitude are calculated, then a subsystem model of SINS/VNS integrated navigation is established. In addition, using the star vectors measured by the large field-of-view star sensor, a high-accuracy attitude matrix of the rover in the inertial frame can be obtained, and a SINS/CNS subsystem model is established. Furthermore, in order to make full use of the complementary advantages of the two subsystems in attitude and position estimation, an interacting multiple model filter is developed. By updating the model probabilities of the subsystems separately in real time, the filter can output accurate navigation information of the rover. Simulation results show that the proposed navigation scheme can significantly improve the estimation accuracy of attitude, position and velocity simultaneously.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"NASA's Perseverance rover will soon begin its primary scientific task: drilling out finger-size cores of martian rock for return to Earth. If all goes well, the first drilling sample will be collected from Jezero crater, a former lakebed, by early August. One kilometer south of its landing site, Perseverance has reached an array of what its operating team calls paver stones—flat, white, dust-coated rocks found throughout the crater floor. Here, on what is believed to be the most ancient terrain in the crater, the team will direct the rover to drill and collect its sample. After that first sampling, the rover will then turn to Séítah, a region of sand dunes and ridges to its west that the car-size rover has skirted past. Séítah has unexpectedly complex geology, including layered terrain that might preserve signs of past life or patterns of water flow. Those exposures could test the idea that Jezero hosted a long-lived lake, with periods of later flooding, as suggested by boulders on the delta front.\",\n",

Results include discovery of outcrops (Voltaire) on Husband Hill that are interpreted to be altered impact melt deposits that incorporated local materials during emplacement. Evidence for extensive volcanic activity and aqueous alteration in the Inner Basin is also detailed, including discovery and characterization of accretionary lapilli and formation of sulfate, silica, and hematite-rich deposits. Use of Spirit's data to understand the range of spectral signatures observed over the Columbia Hills by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) hyperspectral imager (0.4-4 μm) is summarized. We show that CRISM spectra are controlled by the proportion of ferric-rich dust to ferrous-bearing igneous minerals exposed in ripples and other wind-blown deposits. The evidence for aqueous alteration derived from Spirit's data is associated with outcrops that are too small to be detected from orbital observations or with materials exposed from the shallow subsurface during rover activities. Although orbital observations show many other locations on Mars with evidence for minerals formed or altered in an aqueous environment, Spirit's data imply that the older crust of Mars has been altered even more extensively than evident from orbital data. This result greatly increases the potential that the surface or shallow subsurface was once a habitable regime.\",\n",

In this paper we argue that this rover localization should be known to within 0.1 of the distance traversed for local coordinate systems. To test the ability to meet this goal using only descent and rover-based data, we conducted experiments with simulated descent images and Field Integrated Design and Operations Rover data collected during field tests at Silver Lake, California, in April 1999. Specifically, an integrated bundle adjustment system incorporating both descent and rover-based images was developed and used to localize the rover positions. On the basis of surveyed ground control points it is demonstrated that the joint analysis produces RMS errors of 0.24, 0.15, and 0.38 m in x, y, and z% directions in a local coordinate system, respectively, for ground points within 500 m from the landing point and 0.23, 0.21, and 0.46 m within a distance of 1.5 km.

       "    'abstract': 'Determination of the cell or battery impedance is critical to predicting and managing the battery performance, especially in a remote application such as in a spacecraft. While electrochemical impedance spectroscopy provides more quantitative and diverse information on the electrochemical processes, it is less informative in the absence of a reference electrode and/or more cumbersome in multi-cell batteries. DC impedance values, on the other hand, are relatively easy to implement and with subtle variations in the pulse conditions, i.e., pulse magnitude and pulse width, may provide useful trends in the ohmic, charge transfer and mass transfer components. In order to assess the impedance values of the Li-ion cells and batteries and their impact on the current-limiting series resistors in the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER), we, therefore, adopted DC methods under a variety of test conditions, i.e., magnitude and duration of the sampling current pulses, states of charge of the cells and batteries, as well as at different (low) temperatures. Understandably, higher current pluses tend to lower the contribution from the charge transfer, while longer pulses result in a higher share of the diffusional component in the overall impedance. Based on relatively simple analyses, we derived useful trends for the ohmic, charge transfer and mass transfer components of the cell impedance, as a function of temperature and obtained activation energies for these processes. Finally, these measurements assisted us in the assessment of risk associated with the series resistors during the launching of the Mars Rover missions.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, Curiosity, is expected to land on Mars in 2012. The Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) will be used to document martian rocks and regolith with a 2-megapixel RGB color CCD camera with a focusable macro lens mounted on an instrument-bearing turret on the end of Curiosity's robotic arm. <P />The flight MAHLI can focus on targets at working distances of 20.4 mm to infinity. At 20.4 mm, images have a pixel scale of 13.9 μm/pixel. The pixel scale at 66 mm working distance is about the same (31 μm/pixel) as that of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Microscopic Imager (MI). MAHLI camera head placement is dependent on the capabilities of the MSL robotic arm, the design for which presently has a placement uncertainty of ~20 mm in 3 dimensions; hence, acquisition of images at the minimum working distance may be challenging. <P />The MAHLI consists of 3 parts: a camera head, a Digital Electronics Assembly (DEA), and a calibration target. The camera head and DEA are connected by a JPL-provided cable which transmits data, commands, and power. JPL is also providing a contact sensor. The camera head will be mounted on the rover's robotic arm turret, the DEA will be inside the rover body, and the calibration target will be mounted on the robotic arm azimuth motor housing. <P />Camera Head. MAHLI uses a Kodak KAI-2020CM interline transfer CCD (1600 x 1200 active 7.4 μm square pixels with RGB filtered microlenses arranged in a Bayer pattern). The optics consist of a group of 6 fixed lens elements, a movable group of 3 elements, and a fixed sapphire window front element. Undesired near-infrared radiation is blocked using a coating deposited on the inside surface of the sapphire window. The lens is protected by a dust cover with a Lexan window through which imaging can be ac-complished if necessary, and targets can be illuminated by sunlight or two banks of two white light LEDs. Two 365 nm UV LEDs are included to search for fluores-cent materials at night. <P />DEA and Onboard Processing. The DEA incorpo-rates the circuit elements required for data processing, compression, and buffering. It also includes all power conversion and regulation capabilities for both the DEA and the camera head. The DEA has an 8 GB non-volatile flash memory plus 128 MB volatile storage. Images can be commanded as full-frame or sub-frame and the camera has autofocus and autoexposure capa-bilities. MAHLI can also acquire 720p, ~7 Hz high definition video. Onboard processing includes options for Bayer pattern filter interpolation, JPEG-based compression, and focus stack merging (z-stacking). <P />Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS) built and will operate the MAHLI. Alliance Spacesystems, LLC, designed and built the lens mechanical assembly. MAHLI shares common electronics, detector, and software designs with the MSL Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) and the 2 MSL Mast Cameras (Mastcam). Pre-launch images of geologic materials imaged by MAHLI are online at: http://www.msss.com/msl/mahli/prelaunch_images/.\",\n",

The auger bit is surrounded with a metal cylindrical casing and the collected soil is stored in the space between the auger bit and the casing. A drilling test was performed using a simulated Mars soil. It has a layered structure, and between each layer, a thin sheet having a different color is inserted. The simulated soil was drilled and collected preserving the layer structure. It was verified that the sample can be collected with a vertical resolution of about 20 cm.

The Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) designed by Honeybee Robotics has been one of four key Athena science payload instruments mounted on the mechanical arm of the Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity Mars Exploration Rovers. Exposed rock surfaces weather and chemically alter over time. Although such weathered rock can present geological interest in itself, there is a limit to what can be learned. If the geological history of a landing site is to be constructed, then it is important to analyse the unweathered rock interior as clearly as possible. The rock abrasion tool's role is to substitute for a geologist's hammer, removing the weathered and chemically altered outer surface of rocks in order to view the pristine interior. The RAT uses a diamond resin standard common grinding technique, producing a 5mm depth grind with a relatively high surface roughness, achieved over a number of hours per grind and consumes approximately 11 watts of energy. This study assesses the benefits of using ultrasonic assisted grinding to improve surface smoothness. A prototype Micro-Optic UltraSonic Exfoliator (MOUSE) is tested on a range of rock types and demonstrates a number of advantages over the RAT. In addition to a smoother grind finish, these advantages include a lower rate of tool tip wear when using a tungsten carbide tip as opposed to diamond resin, less moving parts, a grind speed of minutes instead of hours, and a power consumption of only 1-5 Watts.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Zhurong Mars rover conducts high resolution in situ surveys in a critical area of Mars. The scientific payloads mounted on the rover include: Navigation and Terrain Camera (NaTeCam), Multispectral Camera (MSCam), Mars Rover Penetrating Radar (RoPeR), Mars Surface Composition Detector (MarSCoDe), Mars Rover Magnetometer (RoMAG) and Mars Climate Station (MCS). Their scientific exploration tasks include studying topography and geological structure of the Mars roving area; surveying the soil structure (profile) of the Mars roving area and searching for water ice; surveying elements, minerals, and rock types of the Mars roving area; and surveying the atmosphere physical characteristics and the surface environment of the Mars roving area. To obtain as much exploration data as possible with limitations on low communication capability and insufficient energy, it is necessary to improve scientific exploration efficiency of the Zhurong Mars rover. There are two major operating conditions for the payloads, conducting roving exploration when the rover moves and in-situ exploration when the rover stops. Several high-efficiency payload exploration modes are developed for those two conditions. When designing the exploration modes, some aspects need to be considered. The first aspect is myriad of constraints, including rover resources and safety, the Martian environment, telecommunication, and the limitations of the software, hardware, and processes involved. The second, the rover is a shared resource: a variety of science and engineering activities must divide the available energy, time, and transmitted data volume, and must coordinate the use of the rover's mast and mobility systems. The third point is that each payload has multiple operating modes that must be optimized and combined. The exploration modes, working with autonomous control based on work mode command set, solved the problem of multiple payloads performing collaborative scientific exploration under resource shortage conditions. The Zhurong Mars rover has successfully completed the scheduled exploration mission. All scientific exploration modes have been verified. The results demonstrate that the exploration modes are suitable and effective, and can meet the requirements for conducting safe, autonomous, and efficient scientific exploration.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Iceland is used as a Mars analog due to the basaltic composition of its rocks and the prevalence of volcano-ice interactions throughout its geological history. Volcano-ice interactions form landforms such as tuyas that are largely composed of pillow basalt, kubbaberg, and hyaloclastite tuff. Candidate tuyas have been identified on the Martian surface in orbiter-based studies, with volcano-ice interactions suggested as a possible cause of episodic flooding on ancient Mars and a potential contributor to its global dust inventory. However, despite the prevalence of glaciovolcanism on Iceland and potentially Mars, little is known about how these deposits are eroded, weathered, and incorporated into sedimentary-transport pathways. <P />We investigate 10 km of a glacio-fluvio-aeolian sedimentary system and its source rocks at the Þórisjökull area in SW Iceland, using analytical techniques available to Mars rovers such as XRF, XRD, and VNIR. Sedimentary samples were collected at three sites along the system in the 2019 SAND-E: Semi-Autonomous Navigation for Detrital Environments Mars 2020-style rover simulation. Samples of the tuyas Lítla and Stóra Björnsfell, and the Skjaldbreiður shield volcano situated in the sediment catchment area were collected and analyzed using the same methods, in addition to optical microscopy. Results of the source rocks show that Lítla Björnsfell contains both olivine-phyric and plagioclase-phyric lava and tuff, meanwhile Stóra Björnsfell and Skjaldbreiður are plagioclase-phyric. Sediments analyzed among the three field sites show variations in geochemistry indicative of sediment sorting and/or changes in sediment source between the subglacial endmembers. Sand compositions are most similar to the tuya kubbaberg and pillow and shield lava flow source rocks, and increase in MgO from the proximal site to the distal site indicating an increase in mafic mineral abundance downstream, linked potentially to sorting. Tuffaceous materials are rarely present in the studied sediments, suggesting they may bypass the studied sites and deposit further downstream. Our results suggest that the high-erodibility of glassy and palagonite-rich subglacial volcanoes could contribute in a similar way to Martian sedimentary systems and be detectable using Mars rover techniques.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The redox evolution of Earths atmosphere from reducing to oxidizing, as indicated by the Great Oxidation Event, significantly changed many aspects of our planets systematic evolution. Mars is cold and dry now, but ~ 3.5 billion years ago, it was warmer and wetter with the formation of river channels, lakes, and hydrous minerals that need the existence of liquid water. The chemically reducing atmosphere can warm early Mars and Earth efficiently and may be the answer for the faint young Sun paradox, while there is not direct geological evidence that a reduced atmosphere actually existed on Mars. The study demonstrates that the atmosphere of early was reducing and that the planet Mars also experienced a Great Oxidation Event of its own, although for different reasons than the Earth. Our work uses infrared spectroscopy and remote sensing to explore early Mars. Through the study of a thick weathering basaltic sequence at Hainan island, South China, we establish spectral, mineralogical, and geochemical indexes for weathering intensity of basalts, which can be used to identify weathering sequence on Mars. Remote sensing spectral indexes for abundance and valence state of Fe are also established. By linking remote sensing and laboratory analyses, we demonstrate that most surface clay minerals were formed by chemical weathering. These ancient soils on Mars experienced substantial Fe loss, indicating that ancient Mars possessed a reducing atmosphere like ancient Earth. Because modern Mars atmosphere is oxidizing, it implies that Mars has also undergone a Great Oxidation Event. In addition, the study presents a challenge to the paleolake model for the Gale crater, which was established on the identification of layered structures and hydrous minerals. We show that the geochemical, mineralogical, and textural observations can be best explained by chemical weathering. The strong depletion of Fe and Mn in the upper sequence of Gale weathering sequences confirms the remote sensing interpretation that Fe was leached from paleosols on Mars. Most of the stratigraphic section explored to date can be explained as eolian and/or volcaniclastic sediments subaerially chemically weathered by acidic precipitation in a reduced atmosphere.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The return of samples from known locations on Mars is among the highest priority goals of the international planetary science community. A possible scenario for Mars Sample Return (MSR) is a series of 3 missions: sample cache, fetch, and retrieval. The NASA Mars 2020 mission represents the first cache mission and was the focus of the CanMars analogue mission described in this paper. The major objectives for CanMars included comparing the accuracy of selecting samples remotely using rover data versus a traditional human field party, testing the efficiency of remote science operations with periodic pre-planned strategic observations (Strategic Traverse Days), assessing the utility of realistic autonomous science capabilities to the remote science team, and investigating the factors that affect the quality of sample selection decision-making in light of returned sample analysis. <P />CanMars was conducted over two weeks in November 2015 and continued over three weeks in October and November 2016 at an analogue site near Hanksville, Utah, USA, that was unknown to the Mission Control Team located at the University of Western Ontario (Western) in London, Ontario, Canada. This operations architecture for CanMars was based on the Phoenix and Mars Exploration Rover missions together with previous analogue missions led by Western with the Mission Control Team being divided into Planning and Science sub-teams. In advance of the 2015 operations, the Science Team used satellite data, chosen to mimic datasets available from Mars-orbiting instruments, to produce a predictive geological map for the landing ellipse and a set of hypotheses for the geology and astrobiological potential of the landing site. The site was proposed to consist of a series of weakly cemented multi-coloured sedimentary rocks comprising carbonates, sulfates, and clays, and sinuous ridges with a resistant capping unit, interpreted as inverted paleochannels. <P />Both the 2015 CanMars mission, which achieved 11 sols of operations, and the first part of the 2016 mission (sols 12-21), were conducted with the Mars Exploration Science Rover (MESR) and a series of integrated and hand-held instruments designed to mimic the payload of the Mars 2020 rover. Part 2 of the 2016 campaign (sols 22-39) was implemented without the MESR rover and was conducted exclusively by the field team as a Fast Motion Field Test (FMFT) with hand-carried instruments and with the equivalent of three sols of operations being executed in a single actual day. A total of 8 samples were cached during the 39 sols from which the Science Team prioritized 3 for \"return to Earth\". Various science autonomy capabilities, based on flight-proven or near-future techniques intended for actual rover missions, were tested throughout the 2016 CanMars activities, with autonomous geological classification and targeting and autonomous pointing refinement being used extensively during the FMFT. Blind targeting, contingency sequencing, and conditional sequencing were also employed. <P />Validation of the CanMars cache mission was achieved through various methods and approaches. The use of dedicated documentarians in mission control provided a detailed record of how and why decisions were made. Multiple separate field validation exercises employing humans using traditional geological techniques were carried out. All 8 of the selected samples plus a range of samples from the landing site region, collected out-of-simulation, have been analysed using a range of laboratory analytical techniques. A variety of lessons learned for both future analogue missions and planetary exploration missions are provided, including: dynamic collaboration between the science and planning teams as being key for mission success; the more frequent use of spectrometers and micro-imagers having remote capabilities rather than contact instruments; the utility of strategic traverse days to provide additional time for scientific discussion and meaningful interpretation of the data; the benefit of walkabout traverse strategies along with multi-sol plans with complex decisions trees to acquire a large amount of contextual data; and the availability of autonomous geological targeting, which enabled complex multi-sol plans gathering large suites of geological and geochemical survey data. <P />Finally, the CanMars MSR activity demonstrated the utility of analogue missions in providing opportunities to engage and educate children and the public, by providing tangible hands-on linkages between current robotic missions and future human space missions. Public education and outreach was a priority for CanMars and a dedicated lead coordinated a strong presence on social media (primarily Twitter and Facebook), articles in local, regional, and national news networks, and interaction with the local community in London, Ontario. A further core objective of CanMars was to provide valuable learning opportunities to students and post-doctoral fellows in preparation for future planetary exploration missions. A learning goals survey conducted at the end of the 2016 activities had 90% of participants \"somewhat agreeing\" or \"strongly agreeing\" that participation in the mission has helped them to increase their understanding of the four learning outcomes.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Opportunity Rover has been exploring Meridiani Planum; concurrently, the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) has been collecting orbital hyperspectral data. Herein, both surface and orbital data are used to characterize surface properties at the Opportunity traverse region around Victoria crater. Results agree with previous studies, which used Opportunity's Panoramic Camera (Pancam) data, and the current study extends estimates of the Hapke single-particle-scattering albedo and asymmetry parameter to a greater spatial and spectral range. Results are useful for determining boundaries between surface units that otherwise look relatively uniform spectrally. This work also provides photometric functions essential for converting spectra to a single viewing geometry to yield more accurate spectral comparisons. Retrieved single-scattering albedos range from 0.42 to 0.57 (0.5663-2.2715 micrometers) and retrieved asymmetry parameters range from -0.27 to -0.17 (moderately backscattering). Surfaces become more backscattering with increasing wavelength above 1 µm. The majority of Victoria crater's ejecta apron is more backscattering than surrounding regions, indicating a change in physical properties. Images taken when the rover traversed this unit show a cover of basaltic soil with superposed millimeter-scale hematitic spherules. Wind streaks on the apron appear smooth (low backscatter) because basaltic sands have partly buried spherules, lessening millimeter-scale roughness. CRISM-derived scattering parameters also show that bedrock-dominated surfaces are less backscattering than soil-covered surfaces, largely due to lower areal abundance of spherules. The ability to analyze surface unit spherule cover is important because it relates to a wetter period during which spherules formed in Meridiani.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The cameras on the Pathfinder probe (Imager for Pathfinder) and the rovers Spirit and Opportunity (Panoramic Camera), Curiosity (Mast Camera) and Perseverance (Mast Camera-Z) produce visible-range spectra of limited wavelength resolution but of great target resolution which allows mineralogical analysis of selected areas within martian rocks. Laboratory spectra of relevant specimens were transformed into the spectra corresponding to each of the above cameras to increase our capability to interpret martian spectral data collected in-situ. The focus was on finding spectral features that can be detected by the cameras on Mars and are diagnostic of specific minerals. The samples are a collection of (1) Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates from submarine hydrothermal sites and (2) of rocks from acid alteration environments containing goethite, hematite, jarosite and Fe-bearing chlorite as these minerals are detectable in the extended visible range. Among all the samples, interstratified glauconite-nontronite has the most unique spectral features and should be easily detectable with the rover cameras. The spectral features of talc from Fe-bearing interstratified specimens are described. These data are especially relevant as glauconite and talc have been proposed to be fairly abundant on Mars and their detections are suggested from remote-sensing near-IR data. Several indices are proposed to assess Fe content on the investigated samples as well as mineral concentration of goethite and hematite. Among these indices, the normalized spectral slope in the range 420-600 nm increases with total Fe content for all samples, whether phyllosilicates, oxides or sulphates (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.7-0.8). For pure phyllosilicates, the slope from 600 to 1010 nm decreases with increasing octahedral Fe (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.75). An index for goethite produced excellent results assessing goethite concentration (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.84). Of all cameras, Mast Camera reproduces the spectra with lowest fidelity and generates the poorest correlations between indices and tested variables. The other three cameras perform similarly.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Artemis is a framework for modeling the dynamical motions of rovers over realistic planetary terrains that include topography generated from orbital or rover-based data and interactions of driven wheels with deformable soils with compaction resistance due to wheel sinkage into soils (Bekker-Wong-Reece model) or with hard-surface contacts dominated by static and dynamic coefficients of friction (contact model). Artemis is being used to simulate flight-based drives for the Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit, Opportunity) and Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity). Critical to realistic simulations is validation of the models by comparison and registration to single-wheel tests in the laboratory using spare flight wheels and testing of rover drives on various surfaces on Earth. In this abstract we report results from modeling test rover drives on deformable soil and hard surfaces. First, a MER test rover was driven over a tilted hard-surfaced plane covered with high friction paint, with separate runs with tilts ranging from 0 to 20 degrees. The Artemis contact model with static and dynamic coefficients of friction of 0.780 and 0.580 reproduced the runs in a manner in which the tests and models were shown to be statistically indistinguishable. Second, the MSL Test Rover was driven over bedrock plates with slopes ranging from 0 to 30 degrees, and Artemis successfully modeled these runs with static and dynamic coefficients of friction of 0.577 and 0.450, respectively. The MSL Test Rover simulations yielded low, linearly increasing slip between 0% and 15% on slopes ranging from 0 to 20 deg, increasing nonlinearly to nearly 100% on the 30 degree slope. Third, both the MER and MSL Test Rovers were deployed to the Dumont Dunes in the Mojave Desert to do side-by-side runs up dune slopes with tilts ranging from 0 to 15 degrees. Test runs and Artemis (Bekker-Wong-Reece model) results are comparable in terms of wheel sinkages and slippage values. Uphill drives led to non-linearly increasing wheel slip-sinkage and slippage with increasing slope, with the MER Test Rover reaching 100% slippages at a 12 deg slope whereas the MSL Test Rover ascended up and over the dunes, but with significant slippage at highest slopes. Downhill runs led to significant wheel skid for both rovers. Artemis was able to simulate the trends seen in all of the runs and provided physical insight as to why the MSL runs were able to ascend the slopes whereas the MER runs were not. Specifically, the models showed that larger radius wheels (21 cm for MER and 50 cm for MSL) are able to direct more torque to the longitudinal drive direction and thus provide more forward thrust for the same pressure-induced sinkage (MER and MSL have approximately the same ground pressures beneath the wheels). Artemis also showed that softer sands with more sinkage and slippage were needed near the crests of the dunes, consistent with in-situ measurements. Results thus show that rover-based tests can be simulated with Artemis. Work is continuing on validation using single-wheel tests in soil chambers at MIT, and initial work has begun on simulating rover drives for Opportunity and Curiosity on Mars.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"China's first Mars rover, Zhurong, landed on the southern region of Utopia Planitia, Mars, on 14 May 2021 (UTC). Zhurong is equipped with the Mars Surface Composition Detection Package (MarSCoDe), which analyzes the Martian surface's material composition. Composed of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), short-wave infrared spectroscopy (SWIR), and a microimaging camera, MarsCoDe can work at a distance of 1.6–7 m to analyze element abundance and the mineralogy of targets on the Martian surface. Analysis shows that the wavelengths of MarSCoDe onboard LIBS spectra acquired within the same probe period will have different degrees of drift, leading to deviation in qualitative and quantitative elemental analysis. This paper finds that the spectrum drift follows a quadratic function relationship with the CCD temperature of the MarSCoDe spectrometer, based on which a wavelength calibration method is established. According to the function, the drift of a certain channel is calculated by the corresponding CCD temperature, and then the wavelength of the spectrum is calibrated by the drift. The accuracy of this calibration method for the position of peak wavelength in the LIBS spectrum can reach about 1/5 of the apparatus spectral width, and the cross-validation analysis using a norite standard sample shows that it is comparable to the wavelength calibration accuracy of the ChemCam onboard data product.\",\n",

A number of different fuel cell power system options for Mars exploration vehicles have been investigated at the Christian-Doppler Laboratory for Fuel Cell Systems in a project funded by the European Space Agency.

       "    'abstract': \"FMC conducted a carefully structured study effort designed to develop an extensive set of mobility and navigation concepts for a planetary exploration vehicle. This focused study commenced with a requirements analysis that defined operational and functional requirements and constraints. Next, the physical system, its value system (evaluation parameters and design criteria) and the martian terrain design environment (surface models) were developed simultaneously. Mobility (the basic vehicle structure, suspension, and power train) and navigation (both global and local navigation including global reference, local terrain assessment, and guidance and control) concepts were developed independently and then integrated. Special attention was paid to the interdependency of navigation and locomotion in order to strike the appropriate balance between autonomy and mobility. Finally, the most promising concepts were subjected to a rigorous, structured evaluation process to derive the best candidate systems. To support the evaluation process, a three-layer computer model of the martian surface was developed. This model was based on the 1/64° Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Mars developed by USGS Flagstaff. Local surface roughness based on measured martian slope distribution and power spectral density was superimposed on the DEM. Rocks based on H. Moore's distribution model were then added. To assess performance, selected concepts were modeled using DADSR from Computer Aided Software Inc., and simulations were run with the vehicle traversing the martian surface model, including one meter high vertical steps and one meter wide crevasses . During the course of this study, over 300 mobility concepts and more than 400 navigation concepts generated during a series of brainstorming sessions evolved into three promising candidate systems. The evolution of these systems is discussed; design details, conclusions and recommendations are presented.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Tests on a prototype engineering model of the Russian Mars 96 Rover were conducted by an international team in and near Death Valley in the United States in late May, 1992. These tests were part of a comprehensive design and testing program initiated by the three Russian groups responsible for the rover development. The specific objectives of the May tests were: (1) evaluate rover performance over different Mars-like terrains; (2) evaluate state-of-the-art teleoperation and autonomy development for Mars rover command, control and navigation; and (3) organize an international team to contribute expertise and capability on the rover development for the flight project. The range and performance that can be planned for the Mars mission is dependent on the degree of autonomy that will be possible to implement on the mission. Current plans are for limited autonomy, with Earth-based teleoperation for the nominal navigation system. Several types of television systems are being investigated for inclusion in the navigation system including panoramic camera, stereo, and framing cameras. The tests used each of these in teleoperation experiments. Experiments were included to consider use of such TV data in autonomy algorithms. Image processing and some aspects of closed-loop control software were also tested. A micro-rover was tested to help consider the value of such a device as a payload supplement to the main rover. The concept is for the micro-rover to serve like a mobile hand, with its own sensors including a television camera.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The article is devoted to a detailed photogeological and topographic analysis of the surface in the region of Oxia Planum, which is the most likely landing site for the rover of the ExoMars mission. The landing site consists of two topographic domains (highlands and lowlands) separated by a sharp regional slope. The highland domain accounts for approximately 25% of the landing site. The main unit of this domain is lava plains with an absolute model age of 3.65 Ga. These plains extend to the west and cover almost the entire surface of the lowlands, where they are overlain by a relatively thin (first tens of meters) layer of material removed from the highlands during the period of fluvial activity. The age of its final phase is estimated at 3.53 Ga. The material to be tested by the ExoMars rover is mainly associated with the final accumulation phase and is represented by deposits of dark and light smooth plains within the lowlands. The material of the dark plains mainly consists of a more coarse-grained fraction of the highland lava plains redeposited near the topographic boundary separating the highlands and lowlands. Deposits of the light plains are dominant at the landing site and are represented by a finer fraction of the material of the lava plains and light mantle material, in which clay minerals are likely predominant.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Autonomous navigation is an important function for a Mars rover to fulfill missions successfully. It is a critical technique to overcome the limitations of ground tracking and control traditionally used. This paper proposes an innovative method based on SINS (Strapdown Inertial Navigation System) with the aid of star sensors to accurately determine the rover's position and attitude. This method consists of two parts: the initial alignment and navigation. The alignment consists of a coarse position and attitude initial alignment approach and fine initial alignment approach. The coarse one is used to determine approximate position and attitude for the rover. This is followed by fine alignment to tune the approximate solution to accurate one. Upon the completion of initial alignment, the system can be used to provide real-time navigation solutions for the rover. An autonomous navigation algorithm is proposed to estimate and compensate the accumulated errors of SINS in real time. High accuracy attitude information from star sensor is used to correct errors in SINS. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can achieve a high precision autonomous navigation for Mars rovers.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The problem addressed in this paper is that of clustering image pixels into regions of homogenous geological texture. Future rovers on Mars will need to be able to intelligently select data collection targets. One goal of intelligent data selection for maximizing scientific return is to sample all distinct types of rocks that may be encountered. Different rock types often have a characteristic visual texture, thus visual texture is rich source of information for separating rocks into different types. Recent work on using texture to segment images has been very successful on images with homogenous textures such as mosaics of Brodatz textures and some natural scenes. The geologic history of a rock leads to irregular shapes and surface textures. As a result, the textures in our images are not as homogeneous as those in Brodatz mosaics. Our approach is to extract textural information by applying a bank of Gabor filters to the image. The resulting texture vectors are then clustered. Banks of filters constrain the relationships of the filter parameters both within a single filter and between filters. Often researchers have used parameter values that are thought to correspond to the human visual system, however the effects of adjusting these parameters have not been thoroughly studied. We systematically explore tradeoffs in the parameter space of the filter bank and quantify the effects of the takeoffs on the quality of the resulting clusters.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Recent aeolian bedforms comprising loose sand are common on the martian surface and provide a mobility hazard to Mars rovers. The ExoMars rover will launch in 2020 to one of two candidate sites: Mawrth Vallis or Oxia Planum. Both sites contain numerous aeolian bedforms with simple ripple-like morphologies. The larger examples are \\'Transverse Aeolian Ridges\\' (TARs), which stereo imaging analyses have shown to be a few metres high and up to a few tens of metres across. Where they occur, TARs therefore present a serious, but recognized and avoidable, rover mobility hazard. There also exists a population of smaller bedforms of similar morphology, but it is unknown whether these bedforms will be traversable by the ExoMars rover. We informally refer to these bedforms as \"mini-TARs\", as they are about an order of magnitude smaller than most TARs observed to date. They are more abundant than TARs in the Oxia Planum site, and can be pervasive in areas. The aim of this paper is to estimate the heights of these features, which are too small to measured using High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), from orbital data alone. Thereby, we aim to increase our knowledge of the hazards in the proposed ExoMars landing sites. We propose a methodology to infer the height of these mini-TARs based on comparisons with similar features observed by previous Mars rovers. We use rover-based stereo imaging from the NASA Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Opportunity and PRo3D software, a 3D visualisation and analysis tool, to measure the size and height of mini-TARs in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars. These are good analogues for the smaller bedforms at the ExoMars rover candidate landing sites. We show that bedform height scales linearly with length (as measured across the bedform, perpendicular to the crest ridge) with a ratio of about 1:15. We also measured the lengths of many of the smaller aeolian bedforms in the ExoMars rover Oxia Planum candidate landing site, and find that they are similar to those of the Meridiani Planum mini-TARs. Assuming that the Oxia Planum bedforms have the same length/height ratio as the MER Opportunity mini-TARs, we combine these data to provide a probabilistic method of inferring the heights of bedforms at the Oxia Planum site. These data can then be used to explore the likely traversability of this site. For example, our method suggests that most of the bedforms studied in Oxia Planum have ridge crests higher than 15 cm, but lower than 25 cm. Hence, if the tallest bedforms the ExoMars rover will be able to safely cross are only 15 cm high, then the Oxia Planum sites studied here contain mostly impassable bedforms. However, if the rover can safely traverse 25 cm high bedforms, then most bedforms here will be smaller than this threshold. As an additional outcome, our results show that the mini-TARs have length/height ratios similar to TARs in general. Hence, these bedforms could probably be classified simply as \"small TARs\", rather than forming a discrete population or sub-type of aeolian bedforms.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Successful designs of vehicles intended for operations on planetary objects outside the Earth demand, just as for terrestrial off-the-road vehicles, a careful assessment of the terrain relevant for the vehicle mission and predictions of the mobility performance to allow rational trade-off's to be made for the choice of the locomotion concept and sizing. Principal issues driving the chassis design for rovers are the stress-strain properties of the planetary surface soil, the distribution of rocks in the terrain representing potential obstacles to movement, and the gravity level on the celestial object in question. Thus far, planetary rovers have been successfully designed and operated for missions to the Earth's moon and to the planet Mars, including NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers (MER's) `Spirit' and `Opportunity' being in operation on Mars since their landings in January 2004. Here we report on the development of a wheel-soil interaction model with application to wheel sizes and wheel loads relevant to current and near-term robotic planetary rovers, i.e. wheel diameters being between about 200 and 500 mm and vertical quasistatic wheel loads in operation of roughly 100 to 200 N. Such a model clearly is indispensable for sizings of future rovers to analyse the aspect of rover mobility concerned with motion across soils. This work is presently funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) as part of the `Rover Chassis Evaluation Tools' (RCET) effort which has developed a set of S/W-implemented models for predictive mobility analysis of rovers in terms of movement on soils and across obstacles, coupled with dedicated testbeds to validate the wheel-soil models. In this paper, we outline the details of the wheel-soil modelling performed within the RCET work and present comparisons of predictions of wheel performance (motion resistance, torque vs. slip and drawbar pull vs. slip) for specific test cases with the corresponding measurements performed in the RCET single wheel testbed and in the RCET system-level testbed, the latter permitting drawbar pull vs. slip measurements for complete rover development vehicles under controlled and homogeneous soil conditions. Required modifications of the wheel-soil model, in particular related to modelling the effect of wheel slip, are discussed. To strengthen the model validation base, we have run single wheel measurements using a spare MER Mars rover wheel and have performed comparisons with MER actual mobility performance data, available through one of us (LR) who is a member of the MER Athena science team.

       "    'abstract': 'The current generation of calibration targets on Mars Rover serve as a color and radiometric reference for the panoramic camera. They consist of a transparent silicon-based polymer tinted with either color or grey-scale pigments and cast with a microscopically rough Lambertian surface for a diffuse reflectance pattern. This material has successfully withstood the harsh conditions existent on Mars. However, the inherent roughness of the Lambertian surface (relative to the particle size of the Martian airborne dust) and the tackiness of the polymer in the calibration targets has led to a serious dust accumulation problem. In this work, non-invasive thin film technology was successfully implemented in the design of future generation calibration targets leading to significant reduction of dust adhesion and capture. The new design consists of a μm-thick interfacial layer capped with a nm-thick optically transparent layer of pure metal. The combination of these two additional layers is effective in burying the relatively rough Lambertian surface while maintaining diffuse properties of the samples which is central to the correct operation as calibration targets. A set of these targets are scheduled for flight on the Mars Phoenix mission.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Due to the long-term weathering and erosion climate, many craters terrains on the surface of Mars are covered with loose weathered sedimentary debris, and Mars rovers traversing these slope-like terrains with soft soils will easily slip or even sink, and may affect the survey missions. Therefore, it is important to study the climbing ability of Mars rovers for Mars exploration missions. This work testes the climbing capability of 'Zhurong' Mars rover based on active-passive suspensions under the simulated Martian terrain and soil parameters were adequately measured. The maximum climbing distance (MCD), slip rate, power, current, energy, and efficiency are analyzed to explore the climbing abilities under different climbing methods, soil states and dynamic parameters (speeds, angular velocity) settings. The test results show that the peristaltic mode is able to continue climbing after a direct climb failure, and the MCD per period is influenced by angular velocity. The power and current data can effectively reflect the difficulty of the rover climbing. Under the same dynamic parameters, the greater the slip rate of the rover, the larger the output power and current. In addition, the speed should be minimized to prolong the climbing distance, no matter it is direct or peristaltic climbing.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'This work details the laboratory analysis of a suite of 10 samples collected from an inverted fluvial channel near Hanksville, Utah, USA as a part of the CanMars Mars Sample Return Analogue Deployment (MSRAD). The samples were acquired along the rover traverse for detailed off-site analysis to evaluate the TOC and astrobiological significance of the samples selected based on site observations, and to address one of the science goals of the CanMars mission: to evaluate the ability of different analytical techniques being employed by the Mars2020 mission to detect and characterize any present biosignatures. Analytical techniques analogous to those on the ExoMars, MSL and the MER rovers were also applied to the samples. The total organic carbon content of the samples was &lt;0.02% for all but 4 samples, and organic biosignatures were detected in multiple samples by UV-Vis-NIR reflectance spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy (532 nm, time-resolved, and UV), which was the most effective of the techniques. The total carbon content of the samples is &lt; 0.3 wt% for all but one calcite rich sample, and organic C was not detectable by FTIR. Carotene and chlorophyll were detected in two samples which also contained gypsum and mineral phases of astrobiological importance for paleoenvironment/habitability and biomarker preservation (clays, gypsum, calcite). They were detected and characterized by multiple techniques, of which passive reflectance was most effective. The sample selected in the field (S2) as having the highest potential for TOC did not have the highest TOC value, however, when considering the sample mineralogy in conjunction with the detection of organic carbon, it is the most astrobiologically relevant. These results highlight the importance of applying multiple techniques for sample characterization and provide insights into their strengths and limitations.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Martian sand ripples present a challenge for rover mobility, with drives over ripples often characterized by high wheel sinkage and slippage that can lead to incipient embedding. Since landing in Gale Crater, Curiosity has traversed multiple sand ripples, including the transverse aeolian ridge (TAR) straddling Dingo Gap on sols 533 and 535. On sol 672, Curiosity crossed backward over a series of sand ripples before ending its drive after high motor currents initiated visual odometry (VO) processing, which detected 77% slip, well in excess of the imposed 60% slip limit. At the end of the drive, the right front wheel was deeply embedded at the base of a ripple flank with &gt;20 cm sinkage and the rear wheels were near a ripple crest. As Curiosity continues its approach to Mount Sharp it will have to cross multiple ripples, and thus it is important to understand Curiosity's performance on sol 672 and over similar ripples. To this end the sol 672 drive was simulated in ARTEMIS (Adams-Based Rover Terramechanics Interaction Simulator), a software tool consisting of realistic rover mechanical models, a wheel-terrain interaction module for deformable and non-deformable surfaces, and realistic terrain models. ARTEMIS results, Dumont Dunes tests performed in the Mojave Desert using the Scarecrow test rover, and single wheel tests performed at MIT indicate that the high slip encountered on sol 672 likely occurred due to a combination of rover attack angle, ripple geometry, and soil properties. When ripple wavelength approaches vehicle length, the rover can reach orientations in which the leading wheels carry minimal normal loads and the trailing wheels sink deeply, resulting in high slippage and insufficient thrust to propel the rover over ripples. Even on relatively benign (i.e. low tilt) terrains, local morphology can impose high sinkage, thus impeding rover motion. Work is underway to quantify Curiosity's drive performance over various ripple geometries to retrieve soil properties and to generate better driving practices across ripples.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'One of the most important discoveries of the Mariner 9 and Viking missions to Mars was evidence of change of the Martian surface by the action of liquid water. From the standpoint of a Mars Rover/Sample Return Mission, fluvial activity on Mars is important in two ways: (1) channel formation has deeply eroded the Martian crust, providing access to relatively undisturbed subsurface units; and (2) much of the material eroded from channels may have been deposited in standing bodies of liquid water. The most striking fluvial erosion features on Mars are the outflow channels. A second type of channel apparently caused by flow of liquid water is the valley systems. These are similar to terrestial drainage systems. The sedimentary deposits of outflow channels are often difficult to identfy. No obvious deposits such as deltaic accumulations are visible in Viking images. Another set of deposits that may be water lain and that date approx. from the epoch of outflow channels are the layered deposits in the Valles Marineris. From the standpoint of a Mars Rover/Sample Return mission, the problem with all of these water-lain sediments is their age, or rather the lack of it.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission, begun in January 2004, has been extremely successful. However, decision-making for many operation tasks of the current MER mission and the 1997 Mars Pathfinder mission is performed on Earth through a predominantly manual, time-consuming process. Unmanned planetary rover navigation is ideally expected to reduce rover idle time, diminish the need for entering safe-mode, and dynamically handle opportunistic science events without required communication to Earth. Successful automation of rover navigation and localization during the extraterrestrial exploration requires that accurate position and attitude information can be received by a rover and that the rover has the support of simultaneous localization and mapping. An integrated approach with Bundle Adjustment (BA) and Visual Odometry (VO) can efficiently refine the rover position. However, during the MER mission, BA is done manually because of the difficulty in the automation of the cross-sitetie points selection. This dissertation proposes an automatic approach to select cross-site tie points from multiple rover sites based on the methods of landmark extraction, landmark modeling, and landmark matching. <P />The first step in this approach is that important landmarks such as craters and rocks are defined. Methods of automatic feature extraction and landmark modeling are then introduced. Complex models with orientation angles and simple models without those angles are compared. The results have shown that simple models can provide reasonably good results. Next, the sensitivity of different modeling parameters is analyzed. Based on this analysis, cross-site rocks are matched through two complementary stages: rock distribution pattern matching and rock model matching. In addition, a preliminary experiment on orbital and ground landmark matching is also briefly introduced. Finally, the reliability of the cross-site tie points selection is validated by fault detection, which considers the mapping capability of MER cameras and the reason for mismatches. Fault detection strategies are applied in each step of the cross-site tie points selection to automatically verify the accuracy. The mismatches are excluded and localization errors are minimized. <P />The method proposed in this dissertation is demonstrated with the datasets from the 2004 MER mission (traverse of 318 m) as well as the simulated test data at Silver Lake (traverse of 5.5 km), California. The accuracy analysis demonstrates that the algorithm is efficient at automatically selecting a sufficient number of well-distributed high-quality tie points to link the ground images into an image network for BA. The method worked successfully along with a continuous 1.1 km stretch. With the BA performed, highly accurate maps can be created to help the rover to navigate precisely and automatically. The method also enables autonomous long-range Mars rover localization.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Since 2001, there have been two, parallel interpretations of Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) observations of Sinus Meridiani, which are: (1) coarse-grained (``gray'') hematite is the only spectral match; and (2) fine-grained hematite with particles closer than ~wavelength (``fine-intimate hematite'', e.g., coating, ferricrete) is a better match, but coarse hematite is also viable. The TES team interpreted the spectra as consistent only with a large deposit (~750 km × 350 km) of coarse hematite (&gt;5-10 μm grain size). Coarse hematite is considered strong evidence for longstanding water, which led to the decision to land the rover Opportunity there. On the other hand, the Aerospace/LPI remote sensing team argued that fine-intimate hematite can better match TES spectra. A thin coating (~5-10 μm thick) and a low exposure (&lt;5%) could cause the observed signatures. The distinction is important because: (1) It is unknown whether fine-grained hematite implies abundant water; (2) Fine-intimate hematite may explain the non-detection of coexisting aqueous alteration minerals and the lack of hematite wind streaks; (3) Current ``hematite abundance maps'' may instead map the surface texture; (4) Coatings may be of astrobiology interest; (5) Studies are needed to determine whether visible-infrared spectra can definitively distinguish fine-intimate from coarse hematite.\",\n",

To assess the quality of stereo ranging results under lossy compression, we acquire stereo image data sets of scenes containing surveyed \"ground truth\" points. We examine the loss of range estimates and the reduction in ranging accuracy as compressed bit rate decreases. We define an image distortion metric that takes into account the effect of some of the processing steps performed in the automated stereo ranging process. Based on empirical stereo image data, we develop a modification to the ICER image compressor that is designed to optimize this distortion metric rather than mean-square-error distortion. The modification does not increase the complexity of ICER and is shown to improve stereo ranging quality as a function of compressed bit rate on test scenes. The modification does not exploit correlations between left and right images in a stereo pair.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A mini-lidar to observe the activity of Martian atmosphere is developed. The 10cm-cube LED mini-lidar was designed to be onboard a Mars rover. The light source of the mini-lidar is a high powered LED of 385nm. LED was adopted as light source because of its toughness against circumference change and physical shock for launch. The pulsed power and the pulse repetition frequency of LED beam were designed as 0.75W (=7.5nJ/10ns) and 500kHz, respectively. Lidar echoes were caught by the specially designed Cassegrain telescope, which has the shorter telescope tube than the usual to meet the 10cm-cube size limit. The high-speed photon counter was developed to pursue to the pulse repetition frequency of the LED light. The measurement range is no shorter than 30m depending back-ground condition. Its spatial resolution was improved as 0.15m (=1ns) by this photon counter. The demonstrative experiment was conducted at large wind tunnel facility of Japan Meteorological Agency. The measurement target was smoke of glycerin particles. The smoke was flowed in the wind tunnel with wind speed of 0 - 5m. Smoke diffusion and its propagation due to the wind flow were observed by the LED mini-lidar. This result suggests that the developed lidar can pursue the structure and the motion of dust devil of &gt;2m.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The recent NASA Mars Rover missions capture the imagination of children, as NASA missions have done for decades. The University of Houston is in the process of developing a prototype of a flexible program that offers children an in-depth educational experience culminating in the design and construction of their own model rover. The existing prototype program is called the Mars Rover Model Celebration. It focuses on students, teachers and parents in grades 3-8. Students will design and build a model of a Mars rover to carry out a student selected science mission on the surface of Mars. The model will be a mock-up, constructed at a minimal cost from art supplies. The students will build the models as part of a project on Mars. The students will be given design criteria for a rover and will do basic research on Mars that will determine the objectives and features of their rover. This project may be used either informally as an after school club or youth group activity or formally as part of a class studying general science, earth science, solar system astronomy or robotics, or as a multi-disciplinary unit for a gifted and talented program. The project's unique strength lies in engaging students in the process of spacecraft design and interesting them in aerospace engineering careers. The project is aimed at elementary and secondary education. Not only will these students learn about scientific fields relevant to the mission (space science, physics, geology, robotics, and more), they will gain an appreciation for how this knowledge is used to tackle complex problems. The low cost of the event makes it an ideal enrichment vehicle for low income schools. It provides activities that provide professional development to educators, curricular support resources using NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) content, and provides family opportunities for involvement in K-12 student learning. This paper will describe the development of a detailed set of new 5E lesson plans to support this project as a classroom activity. The challenge of developing interactive learning activities for planetary science will be explored. These lesson plans incorporate state of the art interactive pedagogy and current NASA Planetary Science materials.\",\n",

By June 2016 the rover had traversed 12.9 km to the southwest, encountering extensive strata that were deposited in a fluvial-deltaic-lacustrine system. Initial drives across sharp sandstone outcrops initiated an unacceptably high rate of punctures and cracks in the thin aluminum wheel skin structures. Initial damage was found to be related to the drive control mode of the six wheel drive actuators and the kinematics of the rocker-bogie suspension. Wheels leading a suspension pivot were forced onto sharp, immobile surfaces by the other wheels as they maintained their commanded angular velocities. Wheel damage mechanisms such as geometry-induced stress concentration cracking and low-cycle fatigue were then exacerbated. A geomorphic map was generated to assist in planning traverses that would minimize further wheel damage. A steady increase in punctures and cracks between landing and June 2016 was due in part because of drives across the sharp sandstone outcrops that could not be avoided. Wheel lifetime estimates show that with careful path planning the wheels will be operational for an additional ten kilometers or more, allowing the rover to reach key strata exposed on the slopes of Mount Sharp.',\n",

Today Mars is a desert. However, when about 4 billion years ago there began an eruption of numerous volcanoes. The planet slowly cooled, volcanic activity has decreased - and ejection of gases into the atmosphere has decreased.

Instead, scientists rely on visualizations created from images sent back by robotic explorers, such as the Curiosity Mars rover. OnSight is a multi-platform visualization tool that helps scientists and engineers to visualize the surface of Mars. Terrain visualization allows scientists to understand the scale and geometric relationships of the environment around the Curiosity rover, both for scientific understanding and for tactical consideration in safely operating the rover. OnSight includes a web-based 2D/3D visualization tool, as well as an immersive mixed reality visualization. In addition, OnSight offers a novel feature for communication among the science team. Using the multiuser feature of OnSight, scientists can meet virtually on Mars, to discuss geology in a shared spatial context. Combining web-based visualization with immersive visualization allows OnSight to leverage strengths of both platforms. This project demonstrates how 3D visualization can be adapted to either an immersive environment or a computer screen, and will discuss advantages and disadvantages of both platforms.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The soft ground and stones on the surface of Mars may cause sinkage of and damage to the wheels of a Mars rover. Therefore, we analyzed the performance of a wheel-step Mars rover from the perspective of terramechanics and structural mechanics. Using China's Mars rover wheel prototype and wheel-soil interaction testbed, we obtained the driving performance of the wheels of a Mars rover under various conditions, including full skidding conditions. The vertical load set in the tests was determined using the gravity of Mars and the mass of the wheel-step Mars rover. The results indicate that the driving torque, sinkage, and resistance coefficient have a linear relationship with the wheel vertical load. An analysis of the structural mechanical characteristics of the wheel of the Mars rover was conducted by testing the radial, axial, torsional, and deflection stiffness. We found that the wheel ribs can improve the stiffness of the wheel but may reduce its driving performance. The analysis methods and evaluation indices can be used to analyze the performance of the wheels of other Mars rovers. Furthermore, the findings of this study can be used to optimize wheel design and motion control of wheel-step Mars exploration rovers.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Rover localization is one of the perquisites for large scale rover exploration. In NASA's Mars 2020 mission, the Ingenuity helicopter is carried together with the rover, which is capable of obtaining high-resolution imagery of Mars terrain, and it is possible to perform localization based on aerial-to-ground (A2G) imagery correspondence. However, considering the low-texture nature of the Mars terrain, and large perspective changes between UAV and rover imagery, traditional image matching methods will struggle to obtain valid image correspondence. In this paper we propose a novel pipeline for Mars rover localization. An algorithm combing image-based rock detection and rock distribution pattern matching is used to acquire A2G imagery correspondence, thus establishing the rover position in a UAV-generated ground map. Feasibility of this method is evaluated on sample data from a Mars analogue environment. The proposed method can serve as a reliable assist in future Mars missions.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Modern and ancient fluvial-deltaic systems on Earth contain highly diverse ecosystems in all terrestrial climates. Fluvial and lacustrine deposits have been discovered on Mars by the NASA Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity, and may be present in Oxia Planum, where the ESA/ROSCOSMOS ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin is set to land in 2023. The primary aim of the ExoMars mission is to search for signs of past and present life on Mars. Whilst fluvio-deltaic-lacustrine sandstones and mudstones are high priority targets for sampling and drilling, it is important to obtain information on the palaeoenvironmental context of these deposits during mission exploration.The geometries of sedimentary structures and distribution of sedimentary facies within fluvial deposits provide information which can be used to reconstruct the geometries and flow parameters of these ancient systems. This provides us with quantitative means with which to make inferences on the ancient climate of Mars, and aids decision making with regards to rover science operations. Here we present a detailed quantitative 3D analysis of fluvial sedimentary architecture on Mars using rover image data. We used the 3D visualization software tool PRo3D1 to render the Shaler outcrop, observed at Yellowknife Bay by the NASA Mars Science Laboratory Rover, Curiosity2, as a scaled 3D textured model using the PRoViP 3D vision processing software3, and to map out key sedimentological features in order to characterize their geometry and dimensions, following existing facies descriptions4 .Mastcam data taken from different rover locations was processed into 3D surfaces and spatially matched to Navcam stereo-panoramas to create a digital outcrop model (DOM). The Shaler DOM was constructed using 17 Mastcam stereo-panoramas taken on Sols 120-121 and 309-324. A 30 m x 13 m area of the NE-SW trending outcrop was analysed. Sedimentary facies, key bounding surfaces and sedimentary structures were mapped out on the DOM (Fig. 1) and the dip and strike of lithological boundaries, key bounding surfaces, and cross-laminations were measured directly from the DOM. Apparent widths and thicknesses of the layers and cross-lamination sets were measured. Regularly spaced, sedimentary logs were collected and matched to illustrate the detailed internal structures of the outcrops analysed. Four types of sedimentary structures were identified; low-angle cross strata dipping to the SE (Fig. 2), ~ 50 cm thick; convex up, sub-parallel undulating laminations forming structures with 20-40 cm amplitude and 2 m wavelength; single sets of trough cross-laminations and compound, stacked cosets of trough cross-laminations, with thicknesses on average 9 cm, and yielding a common palaeoflow direction to the NE and SW. These data allow us to reconstruct the internal architecture of a fluvial bar-form which forms the Shaler outcrop, and quantify the key geometries and their spatial relationships in three-dimensions. These data are highly useful in providing context and relative timings for environmental reconstruction.Figure 1. Line interpretation of Shaler in PRo3D, showing the lithological boundaries (pink lines), facies assocation boundaries (green lines), accretion surfaces (yellow lines), layer contacts (white lines), cross-lamina sets (blue lines) and undulatory convex up bedforms (green lines).

       "    'abstract': \"The Zhurong rover of the China's first Mars Exploration Mission successfully landed on the northern plain of Mars and measured near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra with the Mars Surface Composition Detector (MarSCoDe). There was only orbital NIR hyperspectral data before the success of the Zhurong and Perseverance rovers in 2021. The in situ spectral measurements by the rover face different problems when compared with orbital measurements in data analysis, and thus need a new process pipeline. We analyzed the factors affecting the quality of the NIR spectra acquired by the Zhurong rover, including temperature variation of the detector, non-homogeneous properties of the calibration panels, the atmosphere transmission and Martian dust buildup on the calibration panels. We then identified that the Martian dust buildup on the calibration panels is the main factor affecting the spectra, causing significant discrepancies between the reflectance calibrated with the white and gray panels, respectively, and the systematically higher reflectance values of the Martian soils measured by the Zhurong rover than those by other missions. We proposed a spectral unmixing strategy to restore the radiance of clean calibration panels on the rover and then derived the reflectance spectra with an uncertainty of ∼14%. The method has been tested by simulation experiments in laboratory. The data quality of the in situ NIR spectra of the Zhurong rover is significantly improved after the calibrations based on our pipeline, which is critical for mineral identification on small scales and calibrations of the orbital remote sensing data.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"High resolution Digital Terrain Models (DTM) and Digital Outcrop Models (DOM) are highly useful for geological analysis and mission planning in planetary rover missions. PRo3D, developed as part of the EU-FP7 PRoViDE project, is a 3D viewer in which orbital DTMs and DOMs derived from rover stereo imagery can be rendered in a virtual environment for exploration and analysis. It allows fluent navigation over planetary surface models and provides a variety of measurement and annotation tools to complete an extensive geological interpretation. A key aspect of the image collection during planetary rover missions is determining the optimal viewing positions of rover instruments from different positions ('wide baseline stereo'). For the collection of high quality panoramas and stereo imagery the visibility of regions of interest from those positions, and the amount of common features shared by each stereo-pair, or image bundle is crucial. The creation of a highly accurate and reliable 3D surface, in the form of an Ordered Point Cloud (OPC), of the planetary surface, with a low rate of error and a minimum of artefacts, is greatly enhanced by using images that share a high amount of features and a sufficient overlap for wide baseline stereo or target selection. To support users in the selection of adequate viewpoints an interactive View Planner was integrated into PRo3D. The users choose from a set of different rovers and their respective instruments. PRo3D supports for instance the PanCam instrument of ESA's ExoMars 2020 rover mission or the Mastcam-Z camera of NASA's Mars2020 mission. The View Planner uses a DTM obtained from orbiter imagery, which can also be complemented with rover-derived DOMs as the mission progresses. The selected rover is placed onto a position on the terrain - interactively or using the current rover pose as known from the mission. The rover's base polygon and its local coordinate axes, and the chosen instrument's up- and forward vectors are visualised. The parameters of the instrument's pan and tilt unit (PTU) can be altered via the user interface, or alternatively calculated by selecting a target point on the visualised DTM. In the 3D view, the visible region of the planetary surface, resulting from these settings and the camera field-of-view is visualised by a highlighted region with a red border, representing the instruments footprint. The camera view is simulated and rendered in a separate window and PTU parameters can be interactively adjusted, allowing viewpoints, directions, and the expected image to be visualised in real-time in order to allow users the fine-tuning of these settings. In this way, ideal viewpoints and PTU settings for various rover models and instruments can efficiently be defined, resulting in an optimum imagery of the regions of interest.\",\n",

The first is the problem of interplanetary transfer - what is the best trajectory for getting equipment to Mars and a sample back. Several kinds of trajectories are examined before the conclusion is made that straightforward direct transfers are best. The second orbit design problem is what kind of orbit around Mars is best for making high-resolution maps of sites where the rover could land and gather samples, and how can the same orbiter be used as a relay between a rover on Mars and ground stations on Earth.

The rover was equipped with stereo imaging systems for remote sensing science and hazard avoidance and <SUP>57</SUP>Fe Mössbauer and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers for in situ determination of mineralogy of unprepared rock and soil surfaces. Laboratory data were also obtained using the spectrometers and an X ray diffraction (XRD)/XRF instrument for unprepared samples collected from the rover sites. Simulated orbital and descent image data assembled for the test sites were found to be critical for assessing the geologic setting, formulating hypotheses to be tested with rover observations, planning traverses, locating the rover, and providing a regional context for interpretation of rover-based observations. Analyses of remote sensing and in situ observations acquired by the rover confirmed inferences made from orbital and simulated descent images that the Sunshine Volcanic Field is composed of basalt flows. Rover data confirmed the idea that Lavic Lake is a recharge playa and that an alluvial fan composed of sediments with felsic compositions has prograded onto the playa. Rover-based discoveries include the inference that the basalt flows are mantled with aeolian sediment and covered with a dense pavement of varnished basalt cobbles. Results demonstrate that the combination of rover remote sensing and in situ analytical observations will significantly increase our understanding of Mars and provide key connecting links between orbital and descent data and analyses of returned samples.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The CanMars Mars sample return (MSR) analogue mission was conducted as a field and operational test for the Mars 2020 sample cache rover mission and was the most realistic known MSR rover analogue mission to-date. A rover - similar in scale to that of rover planned for NASA's Mars 2020 mission - was deployed to a scientifically relevant Mars-analogue sedimentary field site with remote mission operations conducted at the University of Western Ontario, Canada; the mission aim was to inform on best practices and optimal approaches for sample acquisition modeled on the Mars 2020 rover mission. The daily operational procedures of the CanMars Science Team were modeled on those of current missions (i.e., Mars Science Laboratory tactical operations), serving as a study of known operational workflows and as a testbed for new approaches. This paper reports on the operational results of CanMars with best-practice recommendations. CanMars was designed as a Mars 2020 mock mission and thus carried similar science objectives; these included (1) advancing the understanding of the habitability potential of a subaqueous sedimentary environment through identifying, characterizing, and caching drilled samples containing high organic carbon (as a proxy for preserved ancient biosignatures) and (2) advancing the understanding of the history of water at the site. The in situ science investigations needed to address these science objectives were guided by the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group goals. Effective and efficient Science Team operational procedures were developed - and many lessons were documented - through daily tactical planning and science investigations employed to meet the sample acquisition goals. In addition to the documentation of the CanMars operational procedures, this paper provides a brief summary of the science results from CanMars with a focus on recommendations for future analogue missions and planetary sample return flight missions, providing specific value to operational procedures for the Mars 2020 rover mission.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Field Integration Design and Operations (FIDO) prototype Mars rover was deployed and operated remotely for 2 weeks in May 2000 in the Black Rock Summit area of Nevada. The blind science operation trials were designed to evaluate the extent to which FIDO-class rovers can be used to conduct traverse science and collect samples. FIDO-based instruments included stereo cameras for navigation and imaging, an infrared point spectrometer, a color microscopic imager for characterization of rocks and soils, and a rock drill for core acquisition. Body-mounted ``belly'' cameras aided drill deployment, and front and rear hazard cameras enabled terrain hazard avoidance. Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data, a high spatial resolution IKONOS orbital image, and a suite of descent images were used to provide regional- and local-scale terrain and rock type information, from which hypotheses were developed for testing during operations. The rover visited three sites, traversed 30 m, and acquired 1.3 gigabytes of data. The relatively small traverse distance resulted from a geologically rich site in which materials identified on a regional scale from remote-sensing data could be identified on a local scale using rover-based data. Results demonstrate the synergy of mapping terrain from orbit and during descent using imaging and spectroscopy, followed by a rover mission to test inferences and to make discoveries that can be accomplished only with surface mobility systems.\",\n",

The decompression process of the separate large module, large and small modules under two types of ambient pressures are simulated. The results show that the largest pressure differential between the inside and outside of the module body is less than 2200 Pa. Because of the small size of the small module, the results for the separate large module and the large/small modules are consistent. The pressure differential between the inside and outside of the rover is mainly influenced by the variation in ambient pressure.',\n",

APXS measured a ∼15 micron surface layer of bedrock and shallow depth of ∼5 cm of drill tailings. DAN is sensitive to the bulk (∼50 cm depth) chlorine abundance and that of other neutron absorbing elements. Joint analysis of APXS and DAN data shows that the chlorine distribution at Gale crater consists of two components: surficial chlorine with concentrations &gt;1 wt.%, possibly controlled by aeolian deposition of Cl-rich dust and surface alteration, and subsurface chlorine with concentrations &lt;1 wt.%, likely a result of groundwater activity in the past.\",\n",

It is anticipated that an in situ energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer will be on board the rover. On such a mission, sample selection is of higher priority than in situ quantitative chemical analysis. With this in mind the authors propose pattern recognition as a simple, direct, and speedy alternative to detailed chemical analysis of the XRF spectra. The validity and efficacy of the pattern recognition technique are demonstrated by the analyses of laboratory XRF spectra obtained from a series of geological samples, in the form both of standardized pressed pellets and as unprepared rocks. It is found that pattern recognition techniques applied to the raw XRF spectra can provide for the same discrimination among samples as knowledge of their actual chemical composition.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Victoria crater is an impact crater about 800 meters in diameter that lies roughly 5 km south of the landing site of the Opportunity rover. After a drive of more than 900 sols, Opportunity has arrived at Victoria crater, and is now engaged in exploration of this, the largest impact crater encountered by either rover. The shape of Victoria crater is unusual. The rim is characterized by a number of prominent alcoves that are U- shaped in plan view, separated by sharp promontories that project toward the crater interior. The alcoves are clearly sites of mass wasting, and this distinctive shape indicates that the crater has been enlarged significantly by mass wasting processes. Since arriving at the crater's rim, Opportunity has been traversing along the rim imaging the stratigraphy exposed on the promontories. The promontories are steep, and most of them expose several to many meters of intact bedrock on near-vertical faces. Because Victoria crater is so large, by imaging these faces we can for the first time study lateral sedimentary facies variations at Meridiani over horizontal length scales of hundreds of meters. On most of the promontories, the uppermost unit is crater ejecta consisting a jumbled breccia of blocks up to a meter or more in size. The ejecta blanket is entirely dominated by blocks of sulfate-rich sandstone; no other material is evident in significant quantities. The ejecta blanket overlies a zone in which sulfate bedrock is extensively fractured in place, with an abrupt contact that is clearly visible around most of the crater rim. We interpret this contact to represent the pre-impact surface. Beneath the fractured zone lies intact bedrock. Mini-TES observations reveal this bedrock to be sulfate-rich over all depths observed to date. Pancam observations of the bedrock show the promontories on the north side of Victoria crater to be dominated by eolian facies. No clasts are visible in Pancam images; evidently the grain size is too small everywhere to be revealed by Pancam, as is the case everywhere else at Meridiani. Bedding, however, is prominent. In several locations, most notably a promontory named Cape St. Mary, there is spectacular eolian cross stratification exposed on the cliff faces, with high-angle truncations indicative of former dune deposits. Elsewhere we see the subparallel bedding and low-angle truncations expected for eolian sand sheets. Generally, then, the stratigraphy at Victoria is consistent with what was observed at Endurance crater, although much better exposed over significantly larger vertical and horizontal scales. Small cobbles have been found on the plains near the crater that are markedly different in composition from the sulfate-rich sandstone that is otherwise so dominant at Victoria. The cobbles lie well within the crater's annulus, and so may represent a minor fraction of the crater ejecta that is more resistant to wind erosion than the very friable sulfate-rich material, and hence better preserved. Compositional data on the cobble Santa Catarina indicate an elemental composition similar to that of the rock Barberton, a pebble near Endurance crater that we concluded was meteoritic on the basis of its kamacite content. Santa Catarina does not contain detectable kamacite, but does contain a significant quantity of troilite. Santa Catarina is also probably meteoritic in origin.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Mars rotorcraft, as an aerial auxiliary platform can assist Mars rover to complete exploration missions, is of great significance in the field of planetary exploration. The complex terrain on Mars limits the working range of the Mars rover, whereas a rotorcraft can acquire high detection speed and efficiency, even fixed-point sample using the ability of vertical takeoff and landing. Very little work has been done to analyze the Mars rotorcraft hovering process and there is also limited experimental data exist on the unique Mars flight conditions. A proper understanding of the hovering process is necessary to design a Mars rotorcraft and verify whether it is appropriate or not. In this work, a modified BEMT-CFD model is developed to analyze inflow distribution in the wingspan direction and to predict the aerodynamic performance of the rotor system. Based on the developed model, a suitable airfoil is selected and the operational parameters are investigated to design a suitable rotor configuration for the Mars rotorcraft. Hover experiments demonstrate that the modified model can effectively predict the rotor hover performance. Using the suitable blade pitch angle and rotational speed, the rotor can generate enough thrust to support a 500 g rotorcraft to fly in the simulated Mars environment.',\n",

It is generally acknowledged that for the autonomous functioning of a rover, intelligent control is required. However, it is clear that adequate mobility is essential in supplying the actuator component of such a control system. The US are committed to the springless \"rocker-bogie\" design which was adopted and demonstrated on the 1997 Mars Pathfinder Sojournor rover. It thus has the advantage of being flight-proven, but there are limitations to its capabilities. The rocker-bogie approach is one of many approaches which are explored here.

       "    'abstract': 'A study was recently carried out by a team from JPL and the DOE to investigate the utility of a DOE-developed 3 kWe surface fission power system for Mars missions. The team was originally tasked to perform a study to evaluate the usefulness and feasibility of incorporation of such a power system into a landed mission. In the course of the study it became clear that the application of such a power system was enabling to a wide variety of potential missions. Of these, two missions were developed, one for a stationary lander and one for a reactor-powered rover. This paper discusses the design of the rover mission, which was developed around the concept of incorporating the fission power system directly into a large rover chassis to provide high power, long range traverse capability. The rover design is based on a minimum extrapolation of technology, and adapts existing concepts developed at JPL for the 2009 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, lander and EDL systems. The small size of the reactor allowed its incorporation directly into an existing large MSL rover chassis design, allowing direct use of MSL aeroshell and pallet lander elements, beefed up to support the significantly greater mass involved in the nuclear power system and its associated shielding. This paper describes the unique design challenges encountered in the development of this mission architecture and incorporation of the fission power system in the rover, and presents a detailed description of the final design of this innovative concept for providing long range, long duration mobility on Mars.',\n",

For 78% of the examined spots the water distribution in depth is found to be homogeneous with a mean content of 2.1±0.5% by mass (here and elsewhere variations correspond to the mean square deviations). For 22% of the examined spots the data require a two-layer model of water distribution down to the sensitivity limit of about 60 cm. The mean water content in upper layer of these spots is about 2-3% by mass, which is close to the content for spots with the homogeneous water distribution. In 8% of the examined spots the water content in the bottom layer at a depth of 27 ± 18 cm increases to 5.6 ± 2.7%. In 14% of the examined spots the water content in the bottom layer at a depth of 14 ± 7 cm decreases to 1.2 ± 0.5%. For interpretation of these results we conclude that the Gale crater has areas both with high and low water content, which correspond to distinct sedimentary layers from different past epochs, when sedimentation process took place underwater and in air correspondingly.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Raman Laser Spectrometer (RLS) on board the ESA/Roscosmos ExoMars 2020 mission will provide precise identification of the mineral phases and the possibility to detect organics on the Red Planet. The RLS will work on the powdered samples prepared inside the Pasteur analytical suite and collected on the surface and subsurface by a drill system. Raman spectroscopy is a well-known analytical technique based on the inelastic scattering by matter of incident monochromatic light (the Raman effect) that has many applications in laboratory and industry, yet to be used in space applications. Raman spectrometers will be included in two Mars rovers scheduled to be launched in 2020. The Raman instrument for ExoMars 2020 consists of three main units: (1) a transmission spectrograph coupled to a CCD detector; (2) an electronics box, including the excitation laser that controls the instrument functions; and (3) an optical head with an autofocus mechanism illuminating and collecting the scattered light from the spot under investigation. The optical head is connected to the excitation laser and the spectrometer by optical fibers. The instrument also has two targets positioned inside the rover analytical laboratory for onboard Raman spectral calibration. The aim of this article was to present a detailed description of the RLS instrument, including its operation on Mars. To verify RLS operation before launch and to prepare science scenarios for the mission, a simulator of the sample analysis chain has been developed by the team. The results obtained are also discussed. Finally, the potential of the Raman instrument for use in field conditions is addressed. By using a ruggedized prototype, also developed by our team, a wide range of terrestrial analog sites across the world have been studied. These investigations allowed preparing a large collection of real, in situ spectra of samples from different geological processes and periods of Earth evolution. On this basis, we are working to develop models for interpreting analog processes on Mars during the mission.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Mars rover Curiosity in Gale crater conducted the first-ever direct chemical and mineralogical comparisons of samples that have clear parent (unaltered) and daughter (altered) relationships. The mineralogy and chemistry of samples within and adjacent to alteration halos in a sandstone formation were established by the Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument and the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), respectively. The Stimson formation sandstones unconformably overlie the Murray mudstone formation and represent the youngest stratigraphic unit explored by Curiosity to date. Aqueous alteration of the parent sandstone resulted in a loss of half of the original crystalline mineral phases and a three-fold increase in X-ray amorphous material. Aqueous fluids extensively leached Mg, Al, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn and other elements from the parent material, decreased the pyroxene to feldspar ratio by a factor of two, introduced Ca and mixed-cation sulfates, and both passively and actively enriched the silica content. Leaching of Mg, Al, Mn, Fe, Ni and Zn and enrichment of Si and S are also observed in alteration halos in the underlying mudstone. These observations are consistent with infiltration of subsurface fluids, initially acidic and then alkaline, propagating along fractures crosscutting the Stimson sandstone and Murray mudstone. The geochemistry and mineralogy suggest a complicated diagenetic history with multiple stages of aqueous alteration under a variety of environmental conditions (e.g. both low and moderate pH). The formation of these alteration halos post-dates lithification of the sandstones and mudstones and represents one of the youngest hydrogeologic events presently known to have occurred in Gale crater.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In 2009, the Canadian Space Agency funded a project to create a field-deployable high-resolution microscope with 3D and multispectral capabilities. The instrument, called the Three-dimensional Exploration Multispectral Microscopic Imager, or TEMMI, was designed to be mounted on the manipulator-arm of a robotic rover for use in analogue planetary exploration missions. TEMMI can acquire images with a resolution as high as 2.2 μm/pixel for an area 5.7 × 2.1 mm in size. As a result, grains sizes as small as ∼6.6 μm (very fine silt) are observable. The instrument has three sets of nine distinct light-emitting diodes with wavelengths ranging from 365 nm to 850 nm. In the 2015 and 2016 CanMars Mars Sample Return analogue mission, this prototype was utilized to observe micro-textures and features of various rocks and unconsolidated samples. Microscopic image data were used to provide micro-scale context for these samples, and was synthesized with other rover-based instrument data on the collected samples to aid in geologic classification and to determine formation and geologic histories of the samples. In addition to colour images acquired during the CanMars mission, TEMMI has also been tested and used extensively in a laboratory setting. The multispectral capabilities of TEMMI demonstrate that it is capable of identifying olivine in a mantle xenolith sample at the mineral-grain scale. The ability of TEMMI to generate 3D models at the micro-texture scale enables observations of intricate flow features that would not be visible at larger scales. While additional development has been identified in order to raise the Technical Readiness Level of TEMMI, the combination of laboratory studies and analogue deployments have demonstrated that it can be a key tool for planetary scientists.',\n",

Improving the efficiency of operations is a necessity for future planetary missions, including Mars 2020, which seek to combine sample targeting with in situ investigations in the fixed amount of time available in primary science operations and with increasingly high public and science community expectations for results. Analogue missions provide an important opportunity to experiment with mission operation strategies and learn lessons that can be incorporated in future missions. Improving the efficiency of operations was a key objective of the 2015 and 2016 CanMars mission deployment.

       "    'abstract': 'In this paper, we present a new autonomous rock detection approach through region contrast. Unlike current state-of-art pixel-level rock segmenting methods, new method deals with this issue in region level, which will significantly reduce the computational cost. Image is firstly splitted into homogeneous regions based on intensity information and spatial layout. Considering the high-water memory constraints of onboard flight processor, only low-level features, average intensity and variation of superpixel, are measured. Region contrast is derived as the integration of intensity contrast and smoothness measurement. Rocks are then segmented from the resulting contrast map by an adaptive threshold. Since the merely intensity-based method may cause false detection in background areas with different illuminations from surroundings, a more reliable method is further proposed by introducing spatial factor and background similarity to the region contrast. Spatial factor demonstrates the locality of contrast, while background similarity calculates the probability of each subregion belonging to background. Our method is efficient in dealing with large images and only few parameters are needed. Preliminary experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms edge-based methods in various grayscale rover images.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The CanMars Mars Sample Return Analogue Deployment (MSRAD) was a closely simulated, end-to-end Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission scenario, with instrumentation, goals, and constraints modeled on the upcoming NASA Mars 2020 rover mission; this paper reports on the post-mission validation of the exercise. The exercise utilized the CSA Mars Exploration Science Rover (MESR) rover, deployed to Utah, USA, at a Mars-analogue field site. The principal features of the field site located near Green River, Utah are Late Jurassic inverted, fluvial paleochannels, analogous to features on Mars in sites being considered for the ESA ExoMars rover mission and present within the chosen landing site for the Mars 2020 rover mission. The in-simulation (\"in-sim\") mission operations team worked remotely from The University of Western Ontario, Canada. A suite of MESR-integrated and hand-held spectrometers was selected to mimic those of the Mars 2020 payload, and a Utah-based, on-site team was tasked with field operations to carry out the data collection and sampling as commanded by the in-sim team. As a validation of the in-sim mission science findings, the field team performed an independent geological assessment. This paper documents the field team\\'s on-site geological assessment and subsequent laboratory and analytical results, then offers a comparison of mission (in-sim) and post-mission (laboratory) science results. The laboratory-based findings were largely consistent with the in-sim rover-derived data and geological interpretations, though some notable exceptions highlight the inherent difficulties in remote science. In some cases, available data was insufficient for lithologic identification given the absence of other important contextual information (e.g., textural information). This study suggests that the in-sim instruments were largely adequate for the Science Team to characterize samples; however, rover-based field work is necessarily hampered by mobility and time constraints with an obvious effect on efficiency but also precision, and to some extent, accuracy of the findings. The data show a dearth of preserved total organic carbon (TOC) - used as a proxy for ancient biosignature preservation potential - in the fluvial-lacustrine system of this field site, suggesting serious consideration with respect to the capabilities and opportunities for addressing the Mars exploration goals. We therefore suggest a thorough characterization of terrestrial sites analogous to those of Mars rover landing sites, and in-depth field studies like CanMars as important, pre-mission strategic exercises.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Selective spectroscopic observations of the dust on the surface of Mars have neither been possible from Earth nor from orbiters as ESA, Mars Express or NASA, MRO. Even in surface soil sampling detailed chemical or mineralogical information about Martian dust cannot be separated from the soil. Remote spectroscopic data contain a mixture of mineralogical components which do not provide any specific information on the dust. Information about chemical composition and mineralogy of the Martian airborne dust was derived from APXS and Mössbauer data from the MER rovers by Goetz et al. (2005). This paper concluded that magnetite and not maghemite is the magnetic phase of the dust, and also that the presence of olivine indicates that liquid water did not play a dominant role in the formation of atmospheric dust. The dust is most likely formed by mechanical comminution comparable to the fine fractions of dust in dune sand on Earth (Nørnberg, P. 2002). Our Mars dust model operates with particles (2-3 μm) that inside consists of primary minerals which are either oxidized down to tenths of nm below the surface or have captured electrically charged nanoparticles of hematite on the surface giving the dust its red colour. Experiments done by Merrison, J.P. et al. ( 2010) showed that mechanical tumbling (abrasion)of a mixture of 10g quartz and 1 g magnetite in a dry process in a Martian atmosphere transformed magnetite to hematite. This experiment supports the dry comminution process indicated by Goetz et al (2005). The XRD analyses on the NASA, MSL are done on a mixture of soil material in which the dust accounts for only a minor part. However, if dust could have been captured separately from the atmosphere e.g. by magnets on the MSL and taken off by e.g. tape or another mechanism that could be transferred into the target holder of the XRD diffractometer on the rover, it could by Rietveld analyses have provided valuable quantitative information on the mineral content of the dust. So we still do not know whether the dust particles consist of primary minerals that are oxidized down to a certain depth in a dry oxidation process, or if the oxidation has taken place under influence of UV radiation. A third possibility is that the primary particles due to electrification of the dust have captured a coating of nano particles of hematite. We could come closer to a solution to these central questions by relatively simple modifications of future rover instrumentation. Goetz, W. et al. 2005 Nature, 436/7, 10.1038.

       "    'abstract': \"In the May 2000 Field Integrated Design and Operations (FIDO) Mars Rover Field Test, an off-site science team was charged with the goal of characterizing the geology of a previously unknown field location by commanding and collecting observations from a robotic rover, similar to those planned for future Mars missions. One unique feature of this test was the degree to which the science team was able to make use of previously acquired overhead remote-sensing data together with ground-based observations by the rover. In particular, an Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer scene covering the region of the field test was used in concert with observations from the rover's near-infrared point spectrometer to develop a coherent and essentially correct geologic story for the test site. Using the overhead data, the science team was able to form hypotheses that were testable using rover observations on the ground. The team was able to establish the provenance of exotic samples within reach of the rover by making a spectroscopic link to units observed from above. The science team was also able to ``extend'' the spectral range of the rover's onboard spectrometer via inferred connections to units mapped from above with greater spectral range. The net result of the success of this rover trial is an increase in experience and confidence for NASA's Mars mission strategy, which features strong ties between early orbital reconnaissance missions for geologic mapping and subsequent rover missions to the surface.\",\n",

To assess the capabilities of the rover, as well as to set priorities for future rover research, it is essential to evaluate the performance of its autonomous navigation system as a function of terrain characteristics. The authors have constructed a new Microrover testbed. In this paper, the authors outline current plans for Mars exploration over the next decade, summarize the design of the lander and rover for the 1996 Pathfinder mission, and introduce a decomposition of rover navigation into four major functions: goal designation, rover localization, hazard detection and path selection. They then describe the Pathfinder approach to each function, present results to date of evaluating the performance of each function and outline their approach to enhancing performance for future missions. The results show key limitations in the quality of rover localization, the speed of hazard detection and the ability of behaviour control algorithms for path selection to negotiate the rock frequencies likely to be encountered on Mars.

When bedrock was added to the abrasive material, the abrasive mass and energy consumption of the convex dome and scale-like unit forms were reduced by 60% and 67.5%, respectively.

       "    'abstract': 'Both the MER and the Mars Pathfinder rovers operated on Mars in an energy-limited mode, since the solar panels generated power during daylight hours only. At other times the rovers relied on power stored in batteries. In comparison, Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) offer a power-enabled paradigm, where power can be generated for long mission durations (measured in years), independently from the Sun, and on a continuous basis. A study was performed at JPL to assess the feasibility of a small-RPS enabled MER-class rover concept and any associated advantages of its mission on Mars, The rover concept relied on design heritage from MER with two significant changes. First, the solar panels were replaced with two single GPHS module based small-RPSs. Second, the Mossbauer spectroscope was substituted with a laser Raman spectroscope, in order to move towards MEPAG defined astrobiology driven science goals. The highest power requirements were contributed to mobility and telecommunication type operating modes, hence influencing power system sizing. The resulting hybrid power system included two small-RPSs and two batteries. Each small-RPS was assumed to generate 50 We of power or 620 Wh/sol of energy (BOL), comparable to that of MER. The two 8 Ah batteries were considered available during peak power usage. Mission architecture, power trades, science instruments, data, communication, thermal and radiation environments, mobility, and mass issues were also addressed. The study demonstrated that a new set of RPS-enabled rover missions could be envisioned for Mars exploration within the next decade, targeting astrobiology oriented science objectives, while powered by 2 to 4 GPHS modules.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Past, present, and forthcoming planetary rover missions to Mars and other planetary bodies are equipped with a large number of scientific cameras. The very large number of images resulting from this, combined with tight time constraints for navigation, measurements, and analyses, pose a major challenge for the mission teams in terms of scientific target evaluation. Shatter cones are the only macroscopic evidence for impact-induced shock metamorphism and therefore impact craters on Earth. The typical features of shatter cones, such as striations and horsetail structures, are particularly suitable for machine learning methods. The necessary training images do not exist for such a case; therefore, we pursued the approach of producing them artificially. Using PRo3D, a viewer developed for the interactive exploration and geologic analysis of high-resolution planetary surface reconstructions, we virtually placed shatter cones in 3-D background scenes processed from true Mars rover imagery. We use PRo3D-rendered images of such scenes as training data for machine learning architectures. Terrestrial analog studies in Ethiopia supported our lab work and were used to test the resulting neural network of this feasibility study. The result showed that our approach with shatter cones in artificial Mars rover scenes is suitable to train neural networks for automatic detection of shatter cones. In addition, we have identified several aspects that can be used to improve the training of the neural network and increase the recognition rate. For example, using background data with a higher resolution in order to have equal resolution of object (shatter cone) and Martian background and increase the number of objects that can be placed in the training data set. Also using better lighting reconstructions and a better radiometric adaption between object and Martian background would further improve the results.',\n",

Several low cost missions, which have been suggested by the Committee for NASA's CORE program, such as the Mars Geoscience Climatology Observer, the Mars Aeronomy Orbiter, and the Mars Surface Network and Surface Probing missions are also covered. Direct Entry-Direct Return and Out-of-Orbit Entry-Orbital Rendezvous and Docking are two versions of a Mars Rover and Sample Return (MRSR) mission discussed in detail. It is concluded that a MRSR mission will require the combination of full Centaur capability, aerocapture at Mars and earth, and direct return to earth to meet major scientific goals. Further studies should be made in orbit assembly, fuel transfer technology, aeromaneuvering, terminal guidance, rover technology, and robotics.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A concept of a compact device for analyzing key isotopic composition in surface materials without sample preparation is presented. This design is based on an advanced modification of Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). First, we developed Laser Ablation Molecular Isotopic Spectrometry (LAMIS) that involves measuring isotope-resolved molecular emission, which exhibits significantly larger isotopic spectral shifts than those in atomic transitions. Second, we used laser ablation to vaporize the sample materials into a plume in which absorption spectra can be measured using a tunable diode laser. The intrinsically high spectral resolution of the diode lasers facilitates measurements of isotopic ratios. The absorption sensitivity can be boosted using cavity enhanced spectroscopy. Temporal behavior of species in a laser ablation plasma from solid samples with various isotopic composition was studied. Detection of key isotopes associated with signs of life (carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen) as well as strontium and boron in laser ablation plume was demonstrated; boron isotopes were quantified. Isotope-resolved spectra of many other molecular species were simulated. The experimental results demonstrate sensitivity to <SUP>86</SUP>Sr, <SUP>87</SUP>Sr, and <SUP>88</SUP>Sr with spectrally resolved measurements for each of them. It is possible to measure strontium isotopes in rocks on Mars for radiogenic age determination. Requirements for spectral resolution of the optical measurement system can be significantly relaxed when the isotopic abundance ratio is determined using chemometric analysis of spectra.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Fusion of orbital and rover imagery is critical to a better understanding of the geological and geomorphological context of current and future rovers on Mars. A critical component of this is to ensure that the most accurate possible co-registration can be achieved between orbital images (co-registered to MOLA tracks) and rover imagery. Currently this is either performed by hand or uses Incremental Bundle Adjustment that does not guarantee compliance of rover and global aerographic co-ordinates. The objective of this work is to produce the most accurate possible Mars rover locations in global aerographic coordinates. The first stage of the work involves automated tie-point/feature based co-registration of high-quality image maps from coarse to fine spatial resolutions, i.e. HRSC ORI (~12.5metre/pixel) and DTM (~75mpp), CTX ORI (~6mpp) and DTM (~6mpp), HiRISE ORI (~0.25mpp) and DTM (~1mpp). The second stage of the work involves stereo reconstruction using ground data captured by Navigation cameras onboard MER-A/-B/MSL rover, bundle adjustment of the NavCam ORI/DTM for wide baseline mosaic, and co-registration of NavCam ORI (0.01mpp) and HiRISE ORI based on combined mutual information and edge feature registration techniques. The registration accuracy achieved is up to the sub pixel level of the coarser layer, e.g. 1.25mpp for HRSC-to-CTX, and the final rover traverse has a resolution of 0.025mpp. The development work is based on previous research/development work on HiRISE/HRSC ORI/DTM co-registration [1], stereo ground reconstruction [2], and multi-resolution data fusion [3] within the EU-FP7-PRoVisG project (http://provisg.eu). The co-registered rover locations and multi-layer map have been partly integrated into the interactive web-GIS system (http://progisweb.eu) developed for scientific data selection and visualisation within the PRoVisG and EU-FP7-PRoViDE project (http://provide-space.eu). Further assessment will be performed within PRoViDE. The final products are sets of co-registered multi-layer maps and updated SPICE kernel files in a common global coordinates.

The key is to utilize wireless power transfer (WPT) to enable multiple receptors extracting energy from the source via magnetic resonant coupling. Namely, the energy transmitter is located on the Mars Rover, whereas the energy receptor is installed in the magnetic sensor. In order to effectively transfer the power, a resonator is installed between the transmitter and the receptors. Based on the proposed idea, the system topology, operation principle, and simulation results are developed. By performing finite element magnetic field analysis, the output power and efficiency of the proposed WPT system are evaluated. It confirms that the Mars Rover carrying with the energy transmitter is capable of loitering around the resonator, while the magnetic sensors on the receptors can be simultaneously charged according to energy-on-demand.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'ChemCam instrument package on the Mars rover, Curiosity, provides new capabilities to probe the abundances of certain trace elements in the rocks and soils on Mars using the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy technique. We focus on detecting and quantifying Li, Ba, Rb, and Sr in targets analyzed during the first 100 sols, from Bradbury Landing Site to Rocknest. Univariate peak area models and multivariate partial least squares models are presented. Li, detected for the first time directly on Mars, is generally low (&lt;15 ppm). The lack of soil enrichment in Li, which is highly fluid mobile, is consistent with limited influx of subsurface waters contributing to the upper soils. Localized enrichments of up to ~60 ppm Li have been observed in several rocks but the host mineral for Li is unclear. Bathurst_Inlet is a fine-grained bedrock unit in which several analysis locations show a decrease in Li and other alkalis with depth, which may imply that the unit has undergone low-level aqueous alteration that has preferentially drawn the alkalis to the surface. Ba (~1000 ppm) was detected in a buried pebble in the Akaitcho sand ripple and it appears to correlate with Si, Al, Na, and K, indicating a possible feldspathic composition. Rb and Sr are in the conglomerate Link at abundances &gt;100 ppm and &gt;1000 ppm, respectively. These analysis locations tend to have high Si and alkali abundances, consistent with a feldspar composition. Together, these trace element observations provide possible evidence of magma differentiation and aqueous alteration.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"In May and June of 2003, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will launch two roving science vehicles on their way to Mars. They will land on Mars in January and February of 2004 and carry out 90-Sol missions. This paper addresses the thermal design architecture of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) developed for Mars surface operations. The surface atmosphere temperature on Mars can vary from 0°C in the heat of the day to -100°C in the early morning, prior to sunrise. Heater usage at night must be minimized in order to conserve battery energy. The desire to minimize nighttime heater energy led to a design in which all temperature sensitive electronics and the battery were placed inside a well-insulated (carbon-opacified aerogel lined) Warm Electronics Box (WEB). In addition, radioisotope heater units (RHU's, non-electric heat sources) were mounted on the battery and electronics inside the WEB. During the Martian day, the electronics inside the WEB dissipate a large amount of energy (over 710 W*hrs). This heat energy raises the internal temperatures inside the WEB. Hardware items that have similar temperature limits were conductively coupled together to share heat and concentrate thermal mass. Thermal mass helped to minimize temperature increases in the hot case (with maximum internal dissipation) and minimize temperature decreases in the cold case (with minimum internal dissipation). In order to prevent the battery from exceeding its maximum allowable flight temperature, wax-actuated passive thermal switches were placed between the battery and an external radiator. This paper discusses the design philosophies and system requirements that resulted in a successful Mars rover thermal design.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Keywords: MER, Mars, Rover, Seismometer Mars has been a subject of human interest for exploration missions for quite some time now. Both rover as well as orbiter missions have been employed to suit mission objectives. Rovers have been preferentially deployed for close range reconnaissance and detailed experimentation with highest accuracy. However, it is essential to strike a balance between the chosen science objectives and the rover operations as a whole. The objective of this proposed mechanism is to design a vehicle (MER) to carry out seismic studies over Martian surface. The conceptual design consists of three units i.e. Mother Rover as a Surrogate (Carrier) and Baby Rovers (two) as seeders for several MEMS-based accelerometer / seismometer units (Nodes). Mother Rover can carry these Baby Rovers, having individual power supply with solar cells and with individual data transmission capabilities, to suitable sites such as Chasma associated with Valles Marineris, Craters or Sand Dunes. Mother rover deploys these rovers in two opposite direction and these rovers follow a triangulation pattern to study shock waves generated through firing tungsten carbide shells into the ground. Till the time of active experiments Mother Rover would act as a guiding unit to control spatial spread of detection instruments. After active shock experimentation, the babies can still act as passive seismometer units to study and record passive shocks from thermal quakes, impact cratering &amp; landslides. Further other experiments / payloads (XPS / GAP / APXS) can also be carried by Mother Rover. Secondary power system consisting of batteries can also be utilized for carrying out further experiments over shallow valley surfaces. The whole arrangement is conceptually expected to increase the accuracy of measurements (through concurrent readings) and prolong life cycle of overall experimentation. The proposed rover can be customised according to the associated scientific objectives and further needs.',\n",

In this work, we show the next stage in the ASTS through examples displaying the identification of bedding planes (not just linear features in rock-face images) and the identification and discrimination of rocks in a rock-strewn landscape (not just rocks). We initially detect the layers and rocks in 2D processing via morphological gradient detection [1] and graph cuts based segmentation [2] respectively. To take this further requires the retrieval of 3D point clouds and the combined processing of point clouds and images for reasoning about the scene. An example is the differentiation of rocks in rover images. This will depend on knowledge of range and range-order of features. We show demonstrations of these \"geo-objects\" using MER and MSL (released through the PDS) as well as data collected within the EU-PRoViScout project (http://proviscout.eu). An initial assessment will be performed of the automated \"geo-objects\" using the OpenSource StereoViewer developed within the EU-PRoViSG project (http://provisg.eu) which is released in sourceforge. In future, additional 3D measurement tools will be developed within the EU-FP7 PRoViDE2 project, which started on 1.1.13. References: [1] M. Woods, A. Shaw, D. Barnes, D. Price, D. Long, D.

       "    'abstract': 'This paper presents an unmanned Mars sample return mission that utilizes propellants manufactured in situ from the Martian atmosphere for the return trip. A key goal of the mission is to demonstrate the considerable benefits that can be realized through the use of indigenous resources and to test the viability of this approach as a precursor to manned missions to Mars. Two in situ propellant combinations, methane/oxygen and carbon monoxide/oxygen, are compared to imported terrestrial hydrogen/oxygen within a single mission architecture, using a single Earth launch vehicle. The mission is assumed to be launched from Earth in 2003. Upon reaching Mars, the landing vehicle aerobrakes, deploys a small satellite, and lands on the Martian surface. Once on the ground, the propellant production unit is activated, and the product gases are liquefied and stored in the empty tanks of the Earth Return Vehicle (ERV). Power for these activities is provided by a dynamic isotope power system. A semiautonomous rover, powered by the indigenous propellants, gathers between 25 and 30 kg of soil and rock samples which are loaded aboard the ERV for return to Earth. After a surface stay time of approximately 1.5 years, the ERV leaves Mars for the return voyage to Earth. When the vehicle reaches the vicinity of Earth, the sample return capsule detaches, and is captured and circularized in LEO via aerobraking maneuvers.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Tasks envisioned for future-generation Mars rovers---sample collection, area survey, resource mining, habitat construction, etc.---will require greatly enhanced navigational capabilities over those possessed by the 1997 Mars Sojourner rover. Many of these tasks will involve cooperative efforts by multiple rovers and other agents, necessitating both high accuracy and the ability to share navigation information among different users. On Earth, satellite-based carrier-phase differential GPS provides a means of delivering centimeter-level, drift-free positioning to multiple users in contact with a reference base station. It would be highly desirable to have a similar navigational capability for use in Mars exploration. This research has originated a new local-area navigation system---a Self-Calibrating Pseudolite Array (SCPA)---that can provide centimeter-level localization to multiple rovers by utilizing GPS-based pseudolite transceivers deployed in a ground-based array. Such a system of localized beacons can replace or augment a system based on orbiting satellite transmitters. Previous pseudolite arrays have relied upon a priori information to survey the locations of the pseudolites, which must be accurately known to enable navigation within the array. In contrast, an SCPA does not rely upon other measurement sources to determine these pseudolite locations. This independence is a key requirement for autonomous deployment on Mars, and is accomplished through the use of GPS transceivers containing both transmit and receive components and through algorithms that utilize limited motion of a transceiver-bearing rover to determine the locations of the stationary transceivers. This dissertation describes the theory and operation of GPS transceivers, and how they can be used for navigation within a Self-Calibrating Pseudolite Array. It presents new algorithms that can be used to self-survey such arrays robustly using no a priori information, even under adverse conditions such as high-multipath environments. It then describes the experimental SCPA prototype developed at Stanford University and used in conjunction with the K9 Mars rover operated by NASA Ames Research Center. Using this experimental system, it provides experimental validation of both successful positioning using GPS transceivers and full calibration of an SCPA following deployment in an unknown configuration.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Much of the Martian surface is covered by a weathering layer (regolith or soil) produced by long-term surface processes such as impact gardening, eolian erosion, water weathering, and glacial modifications. China's first Martian mission, Tianwen-1, employed the Mars Rover Penetrating Radar (RoPeR) to unveil the detailed structure of the regolith layer and assess its loss tangent. The RoPeR radargram revealed the local regolith layer to be highly heterogeneous and geologically complex and characterized by structures that resemble partial or complete crater walls and near-surface impact lenses at a very shallow depth. However, comparable radar data from the Lunar far side are rather uniform, despite the two surfaces being geologically contemporary. The close-to-surface crater presented in this study shows no detectable surface expression, which suggests an accelerated occultation rate for small craters on the surface of Mars as compared to the rate on the Moon. This is probably due to the relentless eolian processes on the Martian surface that led to the burial of the crater and thus shielded it from further erosion. The high loss tangent indicates that the regolith at the Tianwen-1 landing site is not dominated by water ice.\",\n",

Techniques for treatment of these problems, including the use of more than two cameras to reduce correspondence errors and possibly to limit the computational burden of stereo processing, have been tested at JPL. Once a reliable range map is obtained, it must be transformed to a plan view and compared to a stored terrain database, in order to refine the estimated position of the rover and to improve the database.

Distance traveled has always been considered one of the primary criteria when comparing paths. Other metrics such as the run-time to generate the solution or the number of expanded nodes are common measures considered in the literature. However, we want to analyze if those metrics provide useful information in challenging and partially known terrain.

       "    'abstract': 'Compositions of basaltic and ultramafic rocks analyzed by Mars rovers and occurring as Martian meteorites allow predictions of metamorphic mineral assemblages that would form under various thermophysical conditions. Key minerals identified by remote sensing roughly constrain temperatures and pressures in the Martian crust. We use a traditional metamorphic approach (phase diagrams) to assess low-grade/hydrothermal equilibrium assemblages. Basaltic rocks should produce chlorite + actinolite + albite + silica, accompanied by laumontite, pumpellyite, prehnite, or serpentine/talc. Only prehnite-bearing assemblages have been spectrally identified on Mars, although laumontite and pumpellyite have spectra similar to other uncharacterized zeolites and phyllosilicates. Ultramafic rocks are predicted to produce serpentine, talc, and magnesite, all of which have been detected spectrally on Mars. Mineral assemblages in both basaltic and ultramafic rocks constrain fluid compositions to be H<SUB>2</SUB>O-rich and CO<SUB>2</SUB>-poor. We confirm the hypothesis that low-grade/hydrothermal metamorphism affected the Noachian crust on Mars, which has been excavated in large craters. We estimate the geothermal gradient (&gt;20 °C km<SUP>-1</SUP>) required to produce the observed assemblages. This gradient is higher than that estimated from radiogenic heat-producing elements in the crust, suggesting extra heating by regional hydrothermal activity.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"All planetary surface exploration missions thus far have employed traditional rovers with a rocker-bogie suspension. These rovers can navigate moderately rough and flat terrain, but are not designed to traverse rugged terrain with steep slopes. The fact is, however, that the most scientifically interesting missions require exploration platforms with capabilities for navigating such types of rugged terrain. This issue motivates the development of new kinds of rovers that take advantage of the latest advances in robotic technologies to traverse rugged terrain efficiently. This work analyzes one such rover concept called the Transforming Roving-Rolling Explorer (TRREx) that is principally aimed at addressing the above issue. Biologically inspired by the way the armadillo curls up into a ball when threatened, and the way the golden wheel spider uses the dynamic advantages of a sphere to roll down hills when escaping danger, the TRREx rover can traverse like a traditional 6-wheeled rover over conventional terrain, but can also transform itself into a sphere, when necessary, to travel down steep inclines, or navigate rough terrain. This paper investigates the mobility of the TRREx when it is in its rolling mode, i.e. when it is a sphere and can steer itself through actuations that shift its center of mass to achieve the desired direction of roll. A mathematical model describing the dynamics of the rover in this spherical configuration is presented, and actuated rolling is demonstrated through computer simulation. Parametric analyzes that investigate the rover's mobility as a function of its design parameters are also presented. This work highlights the contribution of the spherical rolling mode to the enhanced mobility of the TRREx rover and how it could enable challenging surface exploration missions in the future.\",\n",

This paper deals with the terramechanical characteristics for wheel-soil contact dynamics modelling and simulation and its experimental validation on the basis of the future European Mars rover mission ExoMars.

       "    'abstract': 'Rocks are one of the major Martian surface features and yield significant information about the relevant geology process and the life exploration. However, autonomous Martian rock detection is still a challenging task due to the appearance similar to the background, the view and illumination change. Therefore, this paper presents a gradient-region constrained level set method based on mars rover image for automatic Martian rock extraction. In our method, the evolution function of level set consists of the internal energy term for guaranteeing the deviation of the level set function from a signed distance function and the external energy term, where the gradient-based information is integrated with the locally adaptive region-based information, for robustly driving the motion of the zero-level set toward the object boundaries even in images with ununiform grey scale. The resulting evolution of the level set function is based on the minimisation of the overall energy functional using the standard gradient descent method. As a result, those detected Martian surface regions that are most likely to yield valuable scientific discoveries will be further analysed based on two-dimensional shape characterisation. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, experiments were performed on mars rover image under various terrain and illumination conditions. Results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and efficient for automatically detecting both small-scale and large-scale rocks on Martian surfaces.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Analogue environments on Earth are critical for developing scientific analysis and exploration strategies for missions to the Moon, Mars, and other bodies of interest in the Solar System. India's diverse geography offers several unique, accessible regions that can help us prepare for robotic and crewed space exploration. A few of these regions host current, ongoing planetary analogue studies, whereas others have been identified for pathfinding trips in the near term. We present an overview of these areas, focusing on three regions, and highlight their significance for science, instrumentation, and mission operations testing to the planetary analogue research community. In the Ladakh region of the Himalayas, the locations include: Hypersaline Lakes and Permafrost-Tso Kar; Hot Springs-Puga, Panamik; Sand Dunes and Ponds-Hunder; Glacial Sediments-Khardung La, Taglang La. Work at these sites allows us to conduct comparative habitability studies and test biosignature sensor instruments and test biosignature preservation potential in cold, dry glacial environments. Clay Deposits (with high potential for organic preservation) in dune ponds in Ladakh's arid valleys appear to be similar to dune fields that have been observed on Mars. Another site, the Lonar Crater in Central India, is a rare basalt-impact crater and direct analogue of Jezero Crater, Mars, the site for NASA's 2020 Mars Rover Mission `Perseverance'. The crater's delta will allow us to explore biosignatures in its organic layer depositions from nearby water bodies. Habitability potential studies of Lonar Crater's gullies, ejecta and delta region will help develop UAV or rover-based instruments for Mars. Finally, Kutch, one of the largest salt flats of the world in Western India, has many seasonal hypersaline ponds that support halophilic bacteria. These are ideal analogues for observed salt flats on Mars, which could potentially contain remnants of early Martian life. Kutch also has deposits of Jarosite- a sulphate mineral which is considered a key indicator of hydrous, acidic, and oxidizing conditions on the surface of early Mars. This similarity in the mineral assemblages within altered basalt could help understand surface evolution on Mars.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The present aerospace engineering and science workforce is ageing. It is not clear that the US education system will produce enough qualified replacements to meet the need in the near future. Unfortunately, by the time many students get to high school, it is often too late to get them pointed toward an engineering or science career. Since some college programs require 6 units of high school mathematics for admission, students need to begin consciously preparing for a science or engineering curriculum as early as 6th or 7th grade. The challenge for educators is to convince elementary school students that science and engineering are both exciting, relevant and accessible career paths. This paper describes a program designed to help provide some excitement and relevance. It is based on the task of developing a mobile robot or \"Rover\" to explore the surface of Mars. There are two components to the program, a curriculum unit and a contest. The curriculum unit is structured as a 6-week planetary science unit for elementary school (grades 3-5). It can also be used as a curriculum unit, enrichment program or extracurricular activity in grades 6-8 by increasing the expected level of scientific sophistication in the mission design. The second component is a citywide competition to select the most outstanding models that is held annually at a local college or University. Primary (Grades 3-5) and middle school (Grades 6-8) students interested in science and engineering will design and build of a model of a Mars Rover to carry out a specific science mission on the surface of Mars. The students will build the models as part of a 6-week Fall semester classroom-learning or homework project on Mars. The students will be given design criteria for a rover, and be required to do basic research on Mars that will determine the operational objectives and structural features of their rover. This module may be used as part of a class studying general science, earth science, solar system astronomy or robotics or as a multi-disciplinary unit for a gifted and talented program. A written report on the science objectives and design features of the Rover is required. The program includes specific learning objectives in research skills, language arts (reading scientific literature, preparing a verbal presentation and writing a report), mathematics, science and engineering.The model will be mostly a mock-up, constructed at a minimal cost (estimated cost of less than 10-25) of mostly found objects and simple art supplies.',\n",

Achieving such learning by experience is one of the main challenges of artificial intelligence, but currently it is hindered by the lack of hardware capable of plastic adaptation. Here, we propose a bio-inspired recurrent neural network, mastered by a digital system on chip with resistive-switching synaptic arrays of memory devices, which exploits homeostatic Hebbian learning for improved efficiency. All the results are discussed experimentally and theoretically, proposing a conceptual framework for benchmarking the main outcomes in terms of accuracy and resilience. To test the proposed architecture for reinforcement learning tasks, we study the autonomous exploration of continually evolving environments and verify the results for the Mars rover navigation. We also show that, compared to conventional deep learning techniques, our in-memory hardware has the potential to achieve a significant boost in speed and power-saving.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The characterization of Martian surface winds as a function of time of day and season at one location can increase our knowledge of Mars surface conditions and assist in planning for future unmanned and manned missions. Martian surface winds vary greatly with location, and even at a particular landing site show a high degree of diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variability. Thus characterizing surface wind speeds and directions requires a long time series, which is rarely obtained on Mars. The Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover has been measuring Martian winds since 2012, thus has provided more than two Martian years of wind data at the first Martian landing site to have significant topography, in the trench of Gale Crater. Unfortunately, likely debris impacts during landing damaged the wind sensor, making it difficult to extract useful wind data. The first part of this paper presents a new retrieval that allows \"good\" wind measurements to be extracted from the raw dataset obtained under such conditions. In addition, a characterization of wind speeds and directions in Gale Crater is presented, after processing the full dataset of wind data in order to obtain the representative winds for different diurnal timeslots and seasons. Results suggest complex wind patterns and great variability depending on local time and season. Also, a significant influence by the synoptic scale circulation in the wind patterns is observed, although the local-scale circulation is suggested to be the major contributor to the observed surface winds in Gale Crater.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Tianwen-1, China's first mission to Mars, realized orbiting, landing and roving exploration of Mars through one mission. The probe, which consisted of an orbiter and a rover, was successfully launched on July 23, 2020. The probe was captured by Mars on February 10, 2021 after a 202-days, 475-million-km journey, becoming China's first man-made Mars satellite. The Zhurong rover successfully touched down in southern Utopia Planitia on May 15, 2021. The orbiter and rover had completed tests and started global reconnaissance and roving investigation, respectively. The scientific objectives of Tianwen-1 mission included the following. (1) to map the morphology and geological structure; (2) to investigate the surface regolith characteristics and water-ice distribution; (3) to analyze the surface material composition; (4) to measure the ionosphere and the characteristics of the Martian climate and environment at the surface; (5) to perceive the physical fields (electromagnetic, gravitational) and internal structure of Mars. The five scientific objectives will be achieved by remote and in-situ investigations jointly with 13 scientific instruments. After the successful landing on Mars, we determined that the Zhurong rover landed at 109.925° E, 25.066° N at an elevation of -4099.4 m on the basis of the new sub-metre-resolution images from the high resolution imaging camera on board the Tianwen-1 orbiter. The landing site is near the highland-lowland boundary and multiple suspected shorelines. Under the guidance of the remote sensing survey, the Zhurong rover is travelling south for specific in situ investigation. Supported by the 6 instruments, including the Mars surface composition detector, multispectral camera, navigation and terrain camera, Mars rover penetrating radar, Mars rover magnetometer, and Mars meteorological instrument, the Zhurong rover initial key targets were rocks, rocky fields, transverse aeolian ridges and subsurface structures along the path. Extended investigation will aim at troughs and pitted cones in the distance. A better understanding of the formation mechanisms of these targets may shed light on the historical volcanism and water/ice activities within the landing area, as well as the activities of the wind. These results may reveal the characteristics and evolution of the ancient Martian environment and advance the exploration of the habitability of ancient Mars. The orbiter had entered the remote sensing orbit to carry out global reconnaissance of Mars and provide communication relay for the Zhurong rover during its extended mission phase. Global reconnaissance orbit was a large ellipse with the altitudes of periareon and apoareon about 265 km and 10700 km, respectively. The orbital period is 7.08 hours. There were 7 instruments onboard the orbiter, including moderate resolution imaging camera, high resolution imaging camera, mars orbiter scientific investigation radar, Mars mineralogical spectrometer, Mars orbiter magnetometer, Mars ion and neutral particle analyzer, and Mars energetic particles analyzer. The objectives will focus on the following five aspects: to analyze Martian ionosphere, plasma environment and escape processes, to investigate Martian surface and subsurface water-ice, to investigate Martian regolith types distribution and structure, to map Martian topography characteristic and their changes, and to characterize Martian surface material composition.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The atmosphere of Mars has been found to be very active. Clouds and dust devils are among the dynamic features that have been observed by spacecraft at Mars, including the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER). These phenomena have been the subject of considerable study. Both dust devil and cloud detection campaigns have been conducted using the MER rovers. Such campaigns consist of collecting a sequence of images at pre- selected fixed times and returning the data to Earth for analysis. As the phenomena are, in general rare events, the majority of images do not contain dust devils or clouds. A better understanding of atmospheric dynamics can be developed with increased observations of these dynamic phenomena. One of the most restrictive constraints to obtaining additional observations is the limited downlink bandwidth available. To mitigate the effects of this constraint, we have developed a method to analyze the images onboard. We can identify if an event of interest, in this case either a cloud or dust devil, has been captured and give such images a high downlink priority. This method enables an increase in atmospheric monitoring time on the surface and can result in a higher density of images returned with events of interest. Summary information on the number and type of events can be downlinked for images collected that exceed the downlink allocation, providing less detail, but additional information on the occurrence of the phenomena. The code has been integrated and tested with the MER flight software and is scheduled for upload to the MER rovers as part of the R9.2 software upgrade. We will describe the detection approach and testing results. We are adapting the method to supplement ground-based analysis methods and will provide preliminary results on this endeavor.',\n",

It focuses on students, teachers and parents in grades 3-8. Students design and build a model of a Mars rover to carry out a student selected science mission on the surface of Mars. A total of 140 Mars Rover teachers from the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 cohorts were invited to complete the Mars Rover Teacher Evaluation Survey. The survey was administered online and could be taken at the convenience of the participant. So far ~40 teachers have participated with responses still coming in. A total of 675 students from the 2013-2014 cohort were invited to submit brief self-assessments of their participation in the program. Teachers were asked to rate their current level of confidence in their ability to teach specific topics within the Earth and Life Science realms, as well as their confidence in their ability to implement teaching strategies with their students. The majority of teachers (81-90%) felt somewhat to very confident in their ability to effectively teach concepts related to earth and life sciences to their students. In addition, many of the teachers felt that their confidence in teaching these concepts increased somewhat to quite a bit as a result of their participation in the MRC program (54-88%). The most striking increase in this area was the reported 48% of teachers who felt their confidence in teaching \"Earth and the solar system and universe\" increased \"Quite a bit\" as a result of their participation in the MRC program. The vast majority of teachers (86-100%) felt somewhat to very confident in their ability to effectively implement all of the listed teaching strategies. The most striking increases were the percentage of teachers who felt their confidence increased \"Quite a bit\" as a result of their participation in the MRC program in the following areas: \"Getting students interested in and curious about science\" (63%); \"Teaching science as a co-inquirer with students\" (56%); and \"Continually find better ways to teach science\" (59%).

       "    'abstract': 'On the Mars rover sample return mission the rover vehicle will collect and select samples from different locations on the Martial surface to be brought back to Earth for laboratory studies. It is anticipated that an in situ energy-dispersive X ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer will be on board the rover. On such a mission, sample selection is of higher priority than in situ quantitative chemical analysis. With this in mind we propose pattern recognition as a simple, direct, and speedy alternative to detailed chemical analysis of the XRF spectra. The validity and efficacy of the pattern recognition technique are demonstrated by the analyses of laboratory XRF spectra obtained from a series of geological samples, in the form both of standardized pressed pellets and as unprepared rocks. It is found that pattern recognition techniques applied to the raw XRF spectra can provide for the same discrimination among samples as knowledge of their actual chemical composition.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Solar radiation is the primary energy source for surface planetary life, so that pigments are fundamental components of any surface-dwelling organism. They may therefore have evolved in some form on Mars as they did on Earth. Photosynthetic microbes are major primary producers on Earth, but are concurrently vulnerable to ultraviolet (UV) damage. Using non-intrusive laser Raman spectroscopy to recognize the component parts of biomolecules, we have shown not only the abundance of microbial photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments in situ, but also their spatial distribution within their microhabitat. This essential aspect of their screening or avoidance survival strategies is lost on extraction with solvents. This precise approach is eminently suited to analysis of epilithic (surface) and endolithic (within rocks) communities in Antarctic desert habitats, which are putative analogues of early Mars. Raman spectra for key biomolecules (e.g. the UV screen parietin and the antioxidant [beta]-carotene in epilithic lichens) enable not only the detection of organics in light-stratified habitats, but also the characterization of unknown pigments. Typical biomarkers of astrobiological relevance in our Raman spectral database include scytonemin (a UV screen), chlorophyll (primary photosynthetic pigment), phycocyanin (accessory pigment for shade adaptation) and a hopanoid extracted from 2.5 Gya microbial stromatolite from Australia. This compound dates from the same time period when a wetter Mars could have had a potentially flourishing surface microbial community of its own. Analyses with a laboratory Raman instrument have been extended to a novel miniature Raman spectrometer, operating at the same optimal excitation wavelength (1064 nm) via an In-Ga-As detector. After evaluation in Antarctica, this instrument will be space-qualified for a proposed Mars rover mission to detect biomolecules in the near-surface sediment profile of palaeolakes, using experience with Antarctic biomarkers to interpret alien spectra of fundamental components, without the need for prior knowledge of the identity of the target compounds.',\n",

In the first era, Mars was like on the ancient Earth: had the thick atmosphere, and there was much warmer than it is now. That is, the planet had once been a much more suited for the existence of life there than it is today. In those years, there was a simple life on Earth, and it is possible that it could have arisen on Mars. Falling of fragments of cometary nuclei on the surface of the planet can bring embryos of possible life (panspermia). Later, impact craters - have preserved the resultant life, sprinkled some signs of life by soil emissions. A catastrophic collision with a large asteroid has led to the formation of enormous astrobleme Hellas. It is located near the southern polar region. Now, it is a plan, with a diameter of more than 4000 km, which is narrowed at the bottom to 1500 km and is surrounded by rocks emissions. Its depth reaches 9 km. Emissions of millions of tons of soil on thousands of kilometers - have covered a significant part of the surface of Mars.

Jezero crater holds fluvio-lacustrine deposits of great importance to understanding Mars, however the geology outside Jezero crater includes some of the most ancient Martian crust and holds similar scientific value. One site outside Jezero crater is under consideration for exploration during an extended Mars 2020 mission. This site, coined \"Midway,\" is about thirty kilometers southwest of Jezero crater and just north of the proposed NE Syrtis landing ellipse. The Midway site includes important geology from the Syrtis region, and is within a feasible drive distance from the initial landing ellipse in Jezero crater. In this work, through the use of ArcGIS and HiRISE imaging, a comprehensive geologic map of this Midway region was constructed. The geologic map presented was created with similar methods of geological mapping on Earth. Interpretations were based on variations in erosional pattern, tone, and terrain observed at the 1:5000 scale. Mapping shows the diversity of units within the Midway region and suggests areas of further exploration, both from Earth and in-situ.',\n",

It is shown that data on the elemental composition of the substance in local volumes of the matter with a characteristic linear size of the order of several meters along the rover travers can be obtained using the method of \"tagged charged particles\" (TCP). This method allows to exclude from consideration both the counts caused by gamma-ray radiation from the surrounding surface outside the tested local area and radiation from the spacecraft itself. The method of identifying the composition of the substance in the tested volume with the known types of Martian regolith according to the APXS experiment is also discussed. This method is based on the comparison of measured intensities of the main characteristic nuclear lines with the values corresponding to these lines for known regolith types. It is underlined that the proposed method allows to experimentally detect new types of regolith, the composition of which differs from the composition of all previously known types of Martian matter.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'This paper describes results of the calibration of the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) and the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) built by Raytheon Santa Barbara Remote Sensing (SBRS) under contract to Arizona State University (ASU). This paper also serves as an update to an earlier paper (Silverman, et al., 2003) for mission description and instrument designs (Schueler, et al., 2003). A major goal of the Mars Exploration Program is to help determine whether life ever existed on Mars via detailed in situ studies and surface sample return. It is essential to identify landing sites with the highest probability of containing samples indicative of early pre-biotic or biotic environments. Of particular interest are aqueous and/or hydrothermal environments in which life could have existed, or regions of current near-surface water or heat sources. The search requires detailed geologic mapping and accurate interpretations of site composition and history in a global context. THEMIS and Mini-TES were designed to do this and builds upon a wealth of data from previous experiments. Previous experiments include the Mariner 6/7 Mars Infrared Radiometer (MIR) and Infrared Spectrometer, the Mariner 9 Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS), the Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM), the Phobos Termoscan, and the continuing Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission using the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) and MGS Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES). TES has collected hyperspectral images (up to 286 spectral bands from 6-50 μm) of the entire martian surface, providing an initial global reconnaissance of mineralogy and thermophysical properties. By covering the key 6.3 to 15.0 μm region in both TES and THEMIS, it is possible to combine TES fine spectral resolution with THEMIS fine spatial resolution to achieve a global mineralogic inventory at the spatial scales necessary for detailed geologic studies within the Odyssey data resources. Mini-TES is a single detector Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS), covering the spectral range 5-29 μm at 10 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> spectral resolution. Launched in June 2003, one Mini-TES instrument will fly to Mars aboard each of the two missions of NASA\\'s Mars Exploration Rover Project (MER), named Spirit and Opportunity. The first Mini-TES unit was required to meet a two-year development schedule with proven, flight-tested instrumentation. Therefore, SBRS designed Mini-TES based on proven heritage from the successful MGS TES. THEMIS is based on \"bolt-together\" pushbroom optics and uncooled silicon microbolometer focal plane array (FPA) technology. Sometimes dubbed \"Mars Landsat,\" THEMIS was launched in 2001 on Mars Odyssey, and provides guidance for future lander missions now in preparation for launch. Advanced materials and optical machining allow THEMIS low-scatter, reflective, wide field-of-view (WFOV) pushbroom optics for relatively long dwell-time compared to narrow FOV optics requiring cross-track scanning for equivalent spatial resolution. This allows uncooled silicon microbolometer FPAs, with less signal sensitivity than cryogenically cooled photo-diode FPAs, to meet the THEMIS sensitivity requirements. Instrument design, performance, integration, as well as details of the calibration are discussed. Full instrument and calibration details are available in the Journal of Geophysical Research Mini-TES and THEMIS papers by Christensen, et al.',\n",

Known as the Mars Tumbleweed, it would derive mobility through use of the Martian surface winds. Tumbleweeds could conceivably travel greater distances, cover larger areas of the surface, and provide access to areas inaccessible by conventional vehicles. They would be lightweight and relatively inexpensive, allowing a multiple vehicle network to be deployed on a single mission. Tumbleweeds would be equipped with sensors for conducting science and serve as scouts searching broad areas to identify specific locations for follow-on investigation by other explorers. An extensive assessment of LaRC Tumbleweed concepts was conducted in FY03, including refinement of science mission scenarios, definition of supporting subsystems (structures, power, communications), testing in wind tunnels, and development of a dynamic simulation capability.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Currently Mars missions can collect more data than can be returned. Autonomous systems for data collection, processing and return will aid future Mars rovers in prioritizing and returning geologically important information. We have created a neural net detector that is able to successfully recognize carbonates from Visible/NIR (350-2500 nm) spectra of rocks collected from Mars analog environments (Gilmore et al. JGR 105, 29,223). In order to characterize and improve the detector's sensitivity, we are evaluating the performance of the detector under more realistic Martian environments: 1) carbonate minerals covered with palagonitic dust, and 2) carbonate minerals intimately mixed with basalt and palagonite. Lessons learned will be applied to the generation of additional detectors for minerals of interest (e.g., hydrothermal minerals). Aliquots of Martian Soil Simulant JSC Mars-1 palagonite were sieved to &lt;45 microns and air fall deposited onto a calcite crystal and an adjacent glass slide. Spectra in the Vis/NIR were taken of the calcite after every layer up to a thickness of 270 microns (35 layers) with an Analytical Spectral Devices Field Spec Pro spectrometer operating from 350-2500 nm. The carbonate detector, operating over the range 2000-2400 nm, has an empirically established detection threshold based on training with thousands of synthetic linear combinations of laboratory mineral spectra designed to simulate expected Martian rocks. The detection threshold was reached in this experiment when the dust layer thickness reached 102 -116 microns (78-85% aerial coverage). This corresponds to a real change in the depth of the 2300 nm carbonate band (continuum depth, D= 1- [reflectance at trough center/reflectance at continuum] = ~0.1), and is similar to the detection threshold of the human experimenter. Very thin (~10-20 microns) coatings of palagonite dust had a large effect on the spectral response of the substrate, exemplifying the nonlinear mixing of the two components. We will report on experiments mixing known quantities of carbonate with basalt and palagonite at various grain sizes. We plan to assess the detector's ability to discern and quantify varying amounts of carbonate within the mixtures, and model the spectra as nonlinear mixtures to ascertain if any improvements in the accuracy of the neural net can be achieved. Finally, we will report on the generation and performance of a detector capable of identifying phyllosilicate minerals individually and as a mineral class.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The latest project in a longstanding correspondence between NOAO Tucson and the CADIAS center in La Serena, Chile focuses on Mars and Mars exploration. The objective was to provide a user-friendly yet moderately versatile imitation of the Spirit and Opportunity MARS rovers to be used by grade school students. In addition to basic motion, the rover that was built is able to take color photographs from a rotating camera, and avoid harmful collisions or structural stress via 'bumper' sensors on each of the wheels. The rover is intended to be used remotely via the Internet, and controlled locally via wireless radio. The focus of the project was to create a system that is stable, versatile, and user friendly. The majority of the system was coded in Java, including the micro controller, providing stability and a reliable internet protocol. A partial implementation of Scheme was used as a scripting language, providing an abstraction in the means of communication and control of the robot and allowing for a level of versatility in the range of commands available to the rover and the ease of tweaking those commands. A graphical user interface was implemented to provide a safe means of controlling the rover, creating an 'action queue' of safe commands to be sent as a block to the rover. We hope the project will provide a useful education tool for students in Chile, and potentially in the future students in Tucson as well. <P />Angeli's research was supported by the NOAO/KPNO Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program which is funded by the National Science Foundation through Scientific Program Order No. 3 (AST-0243875) of the Cooperative Agreement No. AST-0132798 between the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) and the NSF.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Information on the surface mineralogy, chemical composition, and lithology of terrestrial planets, as well as on their atmospheres, that can be obtained by earth-based from visible and NIR spectra of light reflected from planetary surfaces is discussed. Such reflectance spectra may have absorption bands in the 1- and 2-micron wavelength regions which originate from crystal field transitions within Fe(2+) ions. Since pyroxenes with Fe(2+) in M2 positions usually dominate the spectra, the resulting 1-micron vs 2-micron spectral determinative curves can be used to identify compositions and structural types of pyroxenes on the surface of a planet or an asteroid. Future spececraft missions to solar system objects will concentrate on remote-sensing experiments using visible and NIR reflectance spectra. These include the Galileo mission to Jupiter; the Mars Orbiter mission to Phoebus; the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby mission; the Cassini mission to Saturn; the Lunar Geoscience Observer; and the Mars Rover/Sample Return mission.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A Self-Calibrating Pseudolite Array (SCPA) is a self-deployable GPS pseudolite-based local-area navigation system that can be used on future robotic and manned planetary explorations. By utilizing bidirectional pseudolite transceivers, the SCPA can provide common global positioning to multiple agents working in a local designated area of a remote planet, including all the benefits of satellite-based carrier-phase differential GPS, such as drift-free, centimeter-level, and three-dimensional positioning, without requiring a satellite constellation above the remote planet. Previous work has demonstrated that changing the relative array geometry by moving a roving transceiver unit enables the SCPA to self-calibrate both the array locations and the rover trajectory to centimeter-level accuracy. This self-calibration capability has overcome the difficulty of autonomous robotic deployment of the pseudolite-based navigation system on remote planets, eliminating the need for accurate a priori position information or precise placement of the array. However, early field trials raised the issue of robustness due to pseudolite signal dropouts caused by multi-path fading, cycle slips, or losing line-of-sight. In order to complete the self-calibration process successfully, the SCPA was required to maintain all the signal locks over the entire calibration maneuver; the lack of necessary ranging measurements due to any signal dropout requires the process to start over. This dissertation solves this robustness issue by two new methods: network-based ranging and an extended self-calibration algorithm. The combination of the two algorithms yields a dual-fault-tolerant system, tolerating at least any two simultaneous dropouts intermittently during the calibration process while still operating in the minimum one-mobile three-stationary transceiver configuration with single-frequency pseudolite signals. The resulting improved robustness has been demonstrated in field trials using the K9 Mars rover platform operated in the Marscape at NASA Ames Research Center. The experimental results validate that the new algorithms can reliably complete the self-calibration process while experiencing severe signal dropouts, yet still achieve centimeter-level calibration performance.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Curiosity mission has captured the imagination of children, as NASA missions have done for decades. The AIAA and the University of Houston have developed a flexible curriculum program that offers children in-depth science and language arts learning culminating in the design and construction of their own model rover. The program is called the Mars Rover Model Celebration. It focuses on students, teachers and parents in grades 3-8. Students learn to research Mars in order to pick a science question about Mars that is of interest to them. They learn principles of spacecraft design in order to build a model of a Mars rover to carry out their mission on the surface of Mars. The model is a mock-up, constructed at a minimal cost from art supplies. This project may be used either informally as an after school club or youth group activity or formally as part of a class studying general science, earth science, solar system astronomy or robotics, or as a multi-disciplinary unit for a gifted and talented program. The project's unique strength lies in engaging students in the process of spacecraft design and interesting them in aerospace engineering careers. The project is aimed at elementary and secondary education. Not only will these students learn about scientific fields relevant to the mission (space science, physics, geology, robotics, and more), they will gain an appreciation for how this knowledge is used to tackle complex problems. The low cost of the event makes it an ideal enrichment vehicle for low income schools. It provides activities that provide professional development to educators, curricular support resources using NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) content, and provides family opportunities for involvement in K-12 student learning. This paper will describe the structure and organization of the 6 week curriculum. A set of 30 new 5E lesson plans have been written to support this project as a classroom activity. The challenge of developing interactive learning activities for planetary science will be explored. These lesson plans incorporate state of the art interactive pedagogy and current NASA Planetary Science materials.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"As Earths population increases, our need for water, energy, and natural resources escalate. Exploring extraterrestrial planets may provide a resource solution for future generations. We researched hypothetical exoplanets to determine ways to allow them to meet mankind's growing needs. Our goal was to identify resources and planetary characteristics that would support future life on our exoplanets. We accomplish this by considering planetary conditions determined by a spacecraft fly-by and examining analogues such as glaciers, the climate of Antarctica, and impact craters, to compare and identify similar conditions on our planets with Earth and Mars. Our planets have a magnetic field, one moon, evidence of past tectonics, and an abundance of atmospheric nitrogen. However, they pose multiple challenges such as a lack of surface water and many mineral resources important for Earths infrastructure, varying atmospheric conditions, and limited sunlight. We investigated findings and methods from Mars rovers, SpaceX, NASA, and recent technological innovations to test the viability of our terrestrial planets and create a plan for ongoing exploration. Para-terraforming, alongside the use of sustainable energy resources and existing minerals on these terrestrial planets, represents a feasible solution to support life beyond Earth. Our proposed para-terraforming process would allow us to mimic the conditions on Earth and make them applicable on extraterrestrial sites. Using technology to imitate Earths atmospheric conditions and purposefully melting surface ice to release usable liquid water could aid in the development of other planetary homes. Our results grant security in the future of space exploration and show that new technology used on Earth, coupled with our knowledge of geological processes, can be applied elsewhere in the universe. As we tackle the final frontier it is imperative that we take new technology, analogues, and open minds to find habitable homes.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Earth-based and orbital spectroscopy and Viking Lander data strongly suggest that rocks on Mars are coated with indurated dust deposits. Rock coatings will influence mineralogical measurements to be acquired in situ from Mars rovers and other surface missions, in that most techniques will detect the coatings and/or coatings plus underlying minerals. In this paper, we present results of experiments on varnished basalt cobbles from the Lunar Crater Volcanic Field, Nevada, using laser Raman spectroscopic microprobe measurements obtained with a 514.5 nm Ar<SUP>+</SUP> laser and irradiation spot sizes from 1 to 20 μm. Measurements from thin sections and fresh, unprepared rock surfaces clearly allow identification of igneous minerals. Varnish spectra acquired from thin sections as well as from unprepared exterior rock surfaces typically show broad peaks consistent with the fine-grained nature of varnish and the dominance of manganese oxide and clay minerals. Several areas also show sharp Raman peaks due to phosphates and anatase, indicative of the heterogeneity of varnish deposits. Raman spectra taken through varnished rock surfaces reveal the mineralogy of coatings (where varnish is &gt;15 μm in thickness) and a combination of coatings and igneous minerals in areas with thinner varnish. Given the abundance of rock coatings observed at the Viking and Pathfinder landing sites, results indicate that techniques such as Raman spectroscopy (and any others with comparable penetration depths) will sample some combination of coatings and underlying rock materials. The ability to make many in situ measurements across samples, coupled with the ability to expose fresh rock surfaces, will be needed to unambiguously characterize both the coatings and the rocks on Mars from future landers and/or rovers.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Visible/short-wave infrared spectral data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) show absorptions attributed to hematite at Vera Rubin ridge (VRR), a topographic feature on northwest Mt. Sharp. The goals of this study are to determine why absorptions caused by ferric iron are strongly visible from orbit at VRR and to improve interpretation of CRISM data throughout lower Mt. Sharp. These goals are achieved by analyzing coordinated CRISM and in situ spectral data along the Curiosity Mars rover's traverse. VRR bedrock within areas that have the deepest ferric absorptions in CRISM data also has the deepest ferric absorptions measured in situ. This suggests strong ferric absorptions are visible from orbit at VRR because of the unique spectral properties of VRR bedrock. Dust and mixing with basaltic sand additionally inhibit the ability to measure ferric absorptions in bedrock stratigraphically below VRR from orbit. There are two implications of these findings: (1) Ferric absorptions in CRISM data initially dismissed as noise could be real, and ferric phases are more widespread in lower Mt. Sharp than previously reported. (2) Patches with the deepest ferric absorptions in CRISM data are, like VRR, reflective of deeper absorptions in the bedrock. One model to explain this spectral variability is late-stage diagenetic fluids that changed the grain size of ferric phases, deepening absorptions. Curiosity's experience highlights the strengths of using CRISM data for spectral absorptions and associated mineral detections and the caveats in using these data for geologic interpretations and strategic path planning tools.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Aeolian bedforms are the signatures of wind interaction with unconsolidated, granular surface materials. Transverse aeolian ridges (TARs) are widely distributed on Mars but their formation remains enigmatic. China's Zhurong rover explored four crescent-shaped TARs, with two horns generally facing south, during the first 107 sols in southern Utopia Planitia, Mars. Rover images show that these bedforms have distinct light and dark variations on their surfaces that likely result from the combination of a bimodal distribution of particle sizes and the crust formed by the accumulation of aeolian dust. Two of these bedforms exhibit erosional forms on their west sides, where megaripples facing in a direction different from that of the crescentic bedforms they disrupt were created by more recent winds from the northeast. Differing erosional configurations of each of these bedforms in close proximity to each other are probably related to the angle between the bedform crest and the wind direction, and may further suggest that erosion of TARs starts from their two flanks. Secondary ridges of TARs widely recognized on Mars could be megaripples formed during this erosion process. At the Zhurong landing site, TARs degraded into megaripples, suggesting that they might share similar formation and evolution mechanisms there and elsewhere on Mars.\",\n",

Here, we present a thermodynamic framework for the solubility of O<SUB>2</SUB> in brines under Martian near-surface conditions. We find that modern Mars can support liquid environments with dissolved O<SUB>2</SUB> values ranging from 2.5 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> mol m<SUP>-3</SUP> to 2 mol m<SUP>-3</SUP> across the planet, with particularly high concentrations in polar regions because of lower temperatures at higher latitudes promoting O<SUB>2</SUB> entry into brines.

Even at the limits of the uncertainties, our findings suggest that there can be near-surface environments on Mars with sufficient O<SUB>2</SUB> available for aerobic microbes to breathe. Our findings may help to explain the formation of highly oxidized phases in Martian rocks observed with Mars rovers, and imply that opportunities for aerobic life may exist on modern Mars and on other planetary bodies with sources of O<SUB>2</SUB> independent of photosynthesis.',\n",

Here, we report our efforts in selecting a landing site for Zhurong within a pre-identified landing region in southern Utopia Planitia. Using the high-resolution images collected by a camera onboard the Tianwen-1 orbiter, the landing region was analyzed in detail in terms of surface slopes, crater densities and rock abundances, which enabled the optimized determination of a landing ellipse (56 × 22 km for the major and minor axes) with minimum hazards and assisted the successful landing of the Zhurong rover. We also characterized the landing site and region after landing. Surface images captured by a camera onboard the Zhurong rover revealed a low rock abundance of approximately 4% at the landing site, similar to the rock measurements from orbital data before landing. Images of the surface features and a hole excavated by the pulsed retrorockets beneath the lander suggested a shallow regolith structure with a surficial layer of dust and sand over a layer of duricrust, and brecciated/fragmented rocks and bedrocks beneath. Crater size-frequency distribution analysis indicated that the landing region might have experienced multiple episodes of resurfacing.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'This paper presents an angular-acceleration sensor that works as either an angular accelerometer or a gravity gradiometer and is based on the micro electromechanical system (MEMS) technology. The changes in the angle of the sensor mass are sensed by a rotational capacitive array transducer that is formed by electrodes on both the stator and rotor dies of the flip-chip-bonded MEMS chip (21 mm × 12.5 mm × 1 mm). The prototype was characterized, demonstrating a fundamental frequency of 27 Hz, a quality factor of 230 in air, and a sensitivity of 6 mV/(rad/s<SUP>2</SUP>). The demonstrated noise floor was less than 0.003 rad/s<SUP>2</SUP>/ √{ Hz } within a bandwidth of 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz, which is comparable with the conventional angular accelerometer and is better than the other reported MEMS sensors in low-frequency ranges. The features of small size and low cost suggest that this MEMS angular-acceleration sensor could be mounted on a drone, a satellite or even a Mars rover, and it is promising to be used for monitoring angular accelerations, aiding seismic recording, mapping gravity anomalies, and other geophysical applications for large-scale terrestrial and space deployments.',\n",

However, the thin and cold Martian atmosphere can heavily increase the consumed power of the rotorcraft blades and reduce the generated thrust, leading to the reduction in power loading. The aerodynamic force generated by the Mars rotorcraft blade can be significantly influenced by the blade structure, which has several main structural characteristics and needs to be well designed. A multivariable optimization design method of blade structure is proposed based on neural network, genetic algorithm, and computational fluid dynamics simulations.

A discrete element wheel-soil simulation system was developed, and three-dimensional discrete element analysis and soil bin tests were conducted. The results show that the masses of the convex and scale-like forms increased by 5.4% and 17%, respectively, and that the tangential cumulative forces decreased by about 40% and 70%, respectively. The wear mass decreased by 53% and 47%, respectively, compared with a prototypical wheel. The simulation shows that the durability increased significantly. The average tangential cumulative forces of the concave and ribbed shapes increased by more than 50%, and the wear mass decreased by 35% and 32%, respectively, compared with a prototypical wheel. The simulation shows that the results were not definitive. The analysis shows that the durability of the wheels can be improved via bionic optimization method.

This paper summarizes the activities and results of the effort to conduct a low-cost, yet meaningful risk management program for the MFEX. The specific activities focused on cost, performance, schedule, and operations risks. Just as the systems engineering process was iterative and produced successive refinements of requirements, designs, etc., so was the risk management process. Qualitative risk assessments were performed first to gain some insights for refining the microrover design and operations concept. These then evolved into more quantitative analyses. Risk management lessons from the manager's perspective is presented for other low-cost, high-risk space missions.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Contrastive learning has recently demonstrated superior performance to supervised learning, despite requiring no training labels. We explore how contrastive learning can be applied to hundreds of thousands of unlabeled Mars terrain images, collected from the Mars rovers Curiosity and Perseverance, and from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Such methods are appealing since the vast majority of Mars images are unlabeled as manual annotation is labor intensive and requires extensive domain knowledge. Contrastive learning, however, assumes that any given pair of distinct images contain distinct semantic content. This is an issue for Mars image datasets, as any two pairs of Mars images are far more likely to be semantically similar due to the lack of visual diversity on the planet's surface. Making the assumption that pairs of images will be in visual contrast - when they are in fact not - results in pairs that are falsely considered as negatives, impacting training performance. In this study, we propose two approaches to resolve this: 1) an unsupervised deep clustering step on the Mars datasets, which identifies clusters of images containing similar semantic content and corrects false negative errors during training, and 2) a simple approach which mixes data from different domains to increase visual diversity of the total training dataset. Both cases reduce the rate of false negative pairs, thus minimizing the rate in which the model is incorrectly penalized during contrastive training. These modified approaches remain fully unsupervised end-to-end. To evaluate their performance, we add a single linear layer trained to generate class predictions based on these contrastively-learned features and demonstrate increased performance compared to supervised models; observing an improvement in classification accuracy of 3.06% using only 10% of the labeled data.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Several interpretations of recurring slope lineae (RSL) have related RSL to the potential presence of transient liquid water on Mars. Such probable signs of liquid water have implications for Mars exploration in terms of rover safety, planetary protection during rover operations, and the current habitability of the planet. Mawrth Vallis has always been a prime target to be considered for Mars rover missions due to its rich mineralogy. Most recently, Mawrth Vallis was one of the two final candidates selected by the European Space Agency as a landing site for the ExoMars 2020 mission. Therefore, all surface features and landforms in Mawrth Vallis that may be of special interest in terms of scientific goals, rover safety, and operations must be scrutinised to better assess it for future Mars missions. Here, we report on the initial detection of RSL candidates in two craters of Mawrth Vallis. The new sightings were made outside of established RSL regions and further prompt the inclusion of a new geographical region within the RSL candidate group. Our inferences on the RSL candidates are based on several morphological and geophysical evidences and analogies: (i) the dimensions of the RSL candidates are consistent with confirmed mid-latitude RSL; (ii) albedo and thermal inertia values are comparable to those of other mid-latitude RSL sites; and (iii) features are found in a summer season image and on the steep and warmest slopes. These results denote the plausible presence of transient liquid brines close to the previously proposed landing ellipse of the ExoMars rover, rendering this site particularly relevant to the search of life. Further investigations of Mawrth Vallis carried out at higher spatial and temporal resolutions are needed to identify more of such features at local scales to maximize the scientific return from the future Mars rovers, to prevent probable biological contamination during rover operations, to evade damage to rover components as brines can be highly corrosive, and to quantify the ability of the regolith at mid-latitudes to capture atmospheric water which is relevant for in-situ-resource utilization.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012 includes an instrument suite consisting of a laser-induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) and a remote micro-imager (RMI). The LIBS is effectively the first Mars microprobe, as its interrogation region is 0.35-0.5 mm in diameter; it can access targets up to 7 m from the rover. The LIBS pulsed laser excites atoms and ions from the target, creating a plasma that emits light at characteristic wavelengths. When calibrated, LIBS provides quantitative elemental abundances. The elements observed on Mars include H, Li, O, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Cl, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zn, Rb, Sr, Ba. The first few laser shots clear the surface of dust, allowing unobscured analyses of the targets. Within the first two years of operation ChemCam has returned &gt; 150,000 spectra from &gt; 4,000 locations along the rover traverse. The RMI is the highest resolution (0.04 mrad) remote imager on the rover and provides context before/after images of the LIBS targets as well as long-distance stand-alone imagery. The ChemCam LIBS instrument concept was developed based on laboratory LIBS instrumentation. For terrestrial field work ChemCam's design with its unshielded laser beam is an eye safety hazard. However, hand-held devices with closed laser-beam designs have been developed. In order to provide a realistic field test prior to the launch of the rover the ChemCam team fielded a backpack LIBS system featuring a shielded laser beam. The system was calibrated using the same 66 geological standards used by the ChemCam instrument prior to flight. During the field test, data was sent remotely to a team back at Los Alamos, effectively imitating operations on Mars and data analysis on the ground. The ground team successfully reported accurate results, identifying the site as rich in kaolinite clay soils.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Hydro- and glaciovolcanism are processes that have taken place on both Earth and Mars. The amount of materials produced by these processes that are present in the martian surface layer is unknown, but may be substantial. We have used Mars rover analogue analysis techniques to examine altered tuff samples collected from multiple hydrovolcanic features, tuff rings and tuff cones, in the American west and from glaciovolcanic hyaloclastite ridges in Washington state and in Iceland. Analysis methods include VNIR-SWIR reflectance, MWIR thermal emissivity, thin section petrography, XRD, XRF, and Mössbauer spectroscopy. We distinguish three main types of tuff that differ prominently in petrography and VNIR-SWIR reflectance: minimally altered sideromelane tuff, gray to brown colored smectite-bearing tuff, and highly palagonitized tuff. Differences are also observed between the tuffs associated with hydrovolcanic tuff rings and tuff cones and those forming glaciovolcanic hyaloclastite ridges. For the locations sampled, hydrovolcanic palagonite tuffs are more smectite and zeolite rich while the palagonitized hyaloclastites from the sampled glaciovolcanic sites are largely devoid of zeolites and relatively lacking in smectites as well. The gray to brown colored tuffs are only observed in the hydrovolcanic deposits and appear to represent a distinct alteration pathway, with formation of smectites without associated palagonite formation. This is attributed to lower temperatures and possibly longer time scale alteration. Altered hydro- or glaciovolcanic materials might be recognized on the surface of Mars with rover-based instrumentation based on the results of this study.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Mars rovers of the future will be fitted with increasingly complex context and sample analysis instrumentation. In the case of Mars 2020, the contact science payload is optimised for petrography. Two complimentary lithochemistry instruments on the rover\\'s arm are designed to generate up to tens of thousands of spectral measurements per experiment [1,2]. These data are generated in addition to microscale context imaging, housekeeping data, and contextual information produced by additional sensors onboard the rover. One consequence of these technological advances is a higher fidelity experience for geologists who may be able to place themselves within virtual field environments. However, mission scientists are grappling with the same challenges as cutting edge of terrestrial investigations: the ability to generate vast datasets, from the nano- to macroscale, is advancing faster than the ability to organise, analyse and share these data. A single sample may yield gigapixel contextual images, microscale topographic models, and huge hyperspectral datasets generated by diverse analytical techniques that are difficult to cross-reference and synthesize. For Mars rover missions, this problem is further compounded by the often-unusual characteristics of flight instruments, which are designed to maximise measurement flexibility and survival in harsh environments, in contrast to the ideal geometries and sample formats prevailing in laboratory set-ups. Furthermore, tight turnarounds are required for the analysis of downlinked datasets, as the time windows during which a platform can be commanded to investigate any given target are limited, and experimental results may affect key operational decisions. This is particularly true for the Mars 2020 mission, which aims to significantly improve the efficiency of rover operations in order to complete an ambitious sample selection, documentation and caching plan during the prime mission in Jezero Crater. To address this problem, we explored novel approaches to increasing the efficiency of data analysis tasks performed by the globally-distributed Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) Science Team. PIXL is an X-ray fluorescence instrument flying aboard the robotic arm of the Mars 2020 rover. In contrast to previously flown XRF instruments (e.g. XRFS, APXS) that have performed elemental chemistry measurements over regions several centimetres in diameter, PIXL will be the first such instrument to generate micron-scale elemental chemistry maps. As well as the peaks expected from the fluorescence of major and minor elements in rocks and soils, and scattered primary radiation, x-ray spectra may also include peaks related to the presence of exotic/unpredicted elements, x-ray diffraction (due to the passage of x-rays through the atomic lattices of minerals), and other spectral artifacts. PIXL scientists desire visualization tools that allow the rapid identification of features such as these that may be hidden within the very large datasets generated by the instrument. An ongoing collaboration between astrobiologists, computer scientists, and computer-human-interaction researchers at the Queensland University of Technology (Australia) and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory has culminated in a software platform (PIXLISE) that will be used to analyse PIXL data returned during Mars 2020 surface operations [3]. PIXLISE users manipulate large, multi-spectral datasets via web browsers and a cloud-based, shareable user session architecture. Innovative data visualization approaches minimise human-in-the-loop processing tasks. For example, a dimensionality reduction technique known as t-SNE is used to autonomously group spectral populations into rock components, such as grains, veins and cements [4]. PIXLISE interfaces with PIQUANT, a quantitative XRF measurement model based on the fundamental parameters approach developed at the University of Washington [5]. PIXL scientists rapidly iterate quantitative calculations by passing spectral populations and model parameters between the PIXLISE and PIQUANT instances running in the cloud. By improving the efficiency of data analysis tasks, and distributing PIQUANT computation across multiple virtual-machines, processing times for complex PIXL experiments have been reduced from days to minutes.

       "    'abstract': 'Aeolian ripples are common in sandy environments on Earth and Mars. On Earth, ripples in sorted dune sands typically are &lt;1 cm high and are erased in high winds. On Mars in similar sands, ripple wavelengths commonly exceed 2 m, with much smaller ripples superimposed. Large Martian ripple sizes and juxtaposition of multiple wavelengths have raised questions about origins and the applicability of terrestrial aeolian physics to different planetary environments. Here, two hypotheses are evaluated for large Martian ripples: (1) fluid/wind drag, analogous to ripples formed under water on Earth, as proposed previously for Martian large ripples; and (2) saltation impact splash, the mechanism creating aeolian ripples of much smaller size on Earth. This study evaluates these hypotheses with numerical experiments and Mars rover observations, and concludes that large Martian ripples develop through the saltation impact splash mechanism. The low-density Martian atmosphere enables aeolian impact ripples to grow much higher into the boundary layer before reaching maximum heights constrained by wind dynamic pressure effects at crests. In this concept, boundary layer conditions influence mature ripple heights more directly than wavelengths. On Mars, low wind dynamic pressures, combined with the impact splash mechanism, also help to explain other distinctively Martian aeolian bedforms, including large longitudinal ripples observed by rovers and orbiters, and transverse aeolian ridges (TARs) distributed widely across the Martian surface. Compared with Earth, low wind dynamic pressures on Mars permit a wider range of ripple sizes, relative ages, morphologies, and orientations in close proximity, as displayed in rover observations.',\n",

Our approach extends ergodic exploration methods, a recent exploration approach that prioritizes complete coverage of a space, with the use of a learned image classifier that automatically detects objects and updates an information map to guide further exploration and localization of objects. Additionally, to improve outcomes of the information collected by our robot's visual sensor, we present a decomposition of the ergodic optimization problem as bi-level coarse and fine solvers, which act respectively on the robot's body and the robot's visual sensor. Our approach is applied to geological survey and localization of rock formations for Mars rovers, with real images from Mars rovers used to train the image classifier. Results demonstrate 1) improved localization of rock formations compared to naive approaches while 2) minimizing the path length of the exploration through the bi-level exploration.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument is a suite of instruments on Mars aboard the Mars Science Laboratory rover. Centered on a mass spectrometer, SAM delivers its data to the PDS Atmosphere's node in PDS3 format. Over five years on Mars the process of operating SAM has evolved and extended significantly from the plan in place at the time the PDS3 delivery specification was written. For instance, SAM commonly receives double or even triple sample aliquots from the rover's drill. SAM also stores samples in spare cups for long periods of time for future analysis. These unanticipated operational changes mean that the PDS data deliveries are absent some valuable metadata without which the data can be confusing. The Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) instrument is another suite of instruments centered on a mass spectrometer bound for Mars. MOMA is part of the European ExoMars rover mission schedule to arrive on Mars in 2021. While SAM and MOMA differ in some important scientific ways - MOMA uses an linear ion trap compared to the SAM quadropole mass spectrometer and MOMA has a laser desorption experiment that SAM lacks - the data content from the PDS point of view is comparable. Both instruments produce data containing mass spectra acquired from solid samples collected on the surface of Mars. The MOMA PDS delivery will make use of PDS4 improvements to provide a metadata context to the data. The MOMA PDS4 specification makes few assumptions of the operational processes. Instead it provides a means for the MOMA operators to provide the important contextual metadata that was unanticipated during specification development. Further, the software tools being developed for instrument operators will provide a means for the operators to add this crucial metadata at the time it is best know - during operations.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Salts and basalt are widespread on the surface of Mars.

Raman spectra were collected from McKinney Basalt samples that were immersed in eight near-saturated brines composed of Na-Cl-H<SUB>2</SUB>O, Na-SO<SUB>4</SUB>-H<SUB>2</SUB>O, Na-ClO<SUB>4</SUB>-H<SUB>2</SUB>O, Mg-Cl-H<SUB>2</SUB>O, Mg-SO<SUB>4</SUB>-H<SUB>2</SUB>O, and two salt mixtures (Mg-Cl-SO<SUB>4</SUB>-H<SUB>2</SUB>O and Na-ClO<SUB>4</SUB>-SO<SUB>4</SUB>-H<SUB>2</SUB>O), as well as ultra-pure water for up to one year. Secondary minerals were observed in the Raman specta, including iron oxides, hydrated sulfates, amorphous silica, phosphates, and carbonates. Detection of these secondary minerals demonstrates the utility of Raman spectroscopy to identify basalt-brine alteration assemblages on Mars. This work also demonstrates that major classes of alteration phases can be distinguished using Raman spectra with resolution similar to those expected from the Raman instruments aboard the Perseverance and Rosalind Franklin Mars rovers.

However, there is a strong reluctance to use these methods on safety-critical systems, which have constraints on safety, stability, and real-time performance. We propose a framework which satisfies these constraints while allowing the use of deep neural networks for learning model uncertainties. Central to our method is the use of Bayesian model learning, which provides an avenue for maintaining appropriate degrees of caution in the face of the unknown. In the proposed approach, we develop an adaptive control framework leveraging the theory of stochastic CLFs (Control Lyapunov Functions) and stochastic CBFs (Control Barrier Functions) along with tractable Bayesian model learning via Gaussian Processes or Bayesian neural networks. Under reasonable assumptions, we guarantee stability and safety while adapting to unknown dynamics with probability 1.

This paper describes FIDO's science instrument payload, which is fully integrated with rover hardware and software. Remote science teams visualize instrument suite data and generate FIDO commands using the Web Interface for Telescience. FIDO's instrument suite has been used in terrestrial laboratory and field tests to simulate Mars operations, to train Mars scientists, and to improve Mars rover mission science operations protocols. The payload includes a deck-mounted, stowable mast that is deployed for acquisition of stereo imaging and spectral reflectance data. The mast head houses Pancam, Navcam (the navigation camera stereo pair), and the Infrared Point Spectrometer (IPS). Pancam is a three-band, false-color infrared (0.65, 0.74, 0.855 μm) stereo imaging system. The three wavelengths were chosen to yield information on the ferric nature of observed minerals. IPS acquires spectral radiance information over the wavelengths from 1.3 to 2.5 μm (spectral resolution ~13 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>). A 4-degree-of-freedom arm is included on the front of FIDO. The arm end effector is the mounting point for a Color Microscopic Imager and an <SUP>57</SUP>Fe Mössbauer Spectrometer.

       "    'abstract': 'Rover traverse distances are increasing at a faster rate than downlink capacity is increasing. As this trend continues, the quantity of data that can be returned to Earth per meter of traverse is reduced. The capacity of the rover to collect data, however, remains high. This circumstance leads to an opportunity to increase mission science return by carefully selecting the data with the highest science interest for downlink. We have developed an onboard science analysis technology for increasing science return from missions. Our technology evaluates the geologic data gathered by the rover, and prioritizes this data for transmission, so that the data with the highest science value is transmitted to Earth. Although our techniques are applicable to a wide range of data modalities, our initial emphasis has focused on image analysis, since images consume a large percentage of downlink bandwidth. We have further focused our foundational work on rocks. Rocks are among the primary features populating the local Martian landscape. Characterization and understanding of rocks on the surface is a first step leading towards more complex in situ regional geological assessments by the rover. Data prioritization involves two processes: the identification of significant features in the data and the use of these features to assess the scientific value of the data. In our current application, we locate rocks in the image data and then extract properties of each rock, including albedo, visual texture and shape. These properties are then used to prioritize the rocks and thereby prioritize the images of the rocks. Three prioritization methods have been developed: identification of key target signatures, novelty detection, and sampling representative rocks. The use of these three methods ensures that three exploratory science objectives are met. First, objects known to be of very high interest, such as indicators of water, will be immediately recognized if encountered. Second, unexpected objects that may lead to key discoveries will be noted. It is, however, also important to have an understanding of the typical characteristics of the region. Our final prioritization method selects the most representative rocks for the downlink queue. As NASA continues to increase the number of high data volume missions simultaneously operating, an onboard mechanism for the prioritization of data tagged for downlink that can increase the science content returned for a fixed bandwidth will be invaluable to scientists who will continue to compete for downlink time.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Ocean Worlds such as Europa and Enceladus are known to harbor subsurface liquid water oceans under their icy crust and are high-priority targets for in situ exploration. Compared to the Moon and Mars, Ocean Worlds likely present a significantly more challenging environment for surface mobility systems due to the extremely cold temperature, high radiation dosage, and poorly constrained material properties under these conditions. Small-diameter wheels such as those used by Mars rovers are prone to slip-sinkage in loose soil and damage from sharp rock and ice formations. A 4-wheel rover with a simple drive system and large deployable compliant tires is proposed as a solution for extreme terrain mobility on Ocean World surfaces. The present work describes the design and construction of a single wheel test rig and a prototype large-diameter deployable wheel for Ocean World rovers and initial test results. The test rig allows independent control of the vertical load, slip ratio, slip angle, and camber angle, and accommodates large-diameter deployable wheels. The test rig features a modular test bed that can simulate varied surface features such as fine-grained ice, smooth hard ice, sharp ice formations, and large ice boulder fields.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'We outline a class of problems, typical of Mars rover operations, that are problematic for current methods of planning under uncertainty. The existing methods fail because they suffer from one or more of the following limitations: 1) they rely on very simple models of actions and time, 2) they assume that uncertainty is manifested in discrete action outcomes, 3) they are only practical for very small problems. For many real world problems, these assumptions fail to hold. In particular, when planning the activities for a Mars rover, none of the above assumptions is valid: 1) actions can be concurrent and have differing durations, 2) there is uncertainty concerning action durations and consumption of continuous resources like power, and 3) typical daily plans involve on the order of a hundred actions. This class of problems may be of particular interest to the UAI community because both classical and decision-theoretic planning techniques may be useful in solving it. We describe the rover problem, discuss previous work on planning under uncertainty, and present a detailed, but very small, example illustrating some of the difficulties of finding good plans.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A mission to the ocean of Europa or Enceladus will require a system for autonomously penetrating through many kilometers of ice and several teams are developing ice probe concepts that could one day make this journey. These systems will utilize heat from a radioisotope source or a small fission reactor to warm and melt the ice ahead of the probe and to provide sufficient heat along their sidewall to prevent freezing in. A high-fidelity simulation of ice probe performance is a critical element of path-to-flight, providing proof-of-concept that these systems can attain the ocean in a reasonable time. As an analogue, entry descent and landing (EDL) for Mars rovers is developed through a rigorously-validated Monte Carlo simulation, achieving high a priori confidence of success despite an uncertain atmosphere. To achieve an equivalent program for Ocean Worlds, a consortium of institutions is working to develop the Cryobot Descent Simulator, which combines a Monte Carlo simulation of the ice environment with quasi-analytic thermodynamic models that calculate probe speed. These analytic models are being validated and tuned using computationally slower but higher fidelity finite element models, which in turn will be validated with empirical data from testbeds and field campaigns. Progress on the Cryobot Descent Simulator and its validation will be reported, including intermediate results that will be informative to ice probe design and mission architecture.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Plants are the ultimate and necessary solution for O2 production at a human base on Mars. Currently it is unknown if seeds can germinate on the Martian surface. The Mars Plant growth experiment (MPX) is a proposal for the first step in the development of a plant- based O2 production system by demonstrating plant germination and growth on the Martian surface. There is currently no planetary protection policy in place that covers plants on the Martian surface. We describe a planetary protection plan in compliance with NASA and COSPAR policy for a closed plant growth chamber on a Mars rover. We divide the plant growth chamber into two categories for planetary protection, the Outside: the outside of the chamber exposed to the Martian environment, and the Inside: the inside of the chamber which is sealed off from Mars atmosphere and contains the plant seeds and ancillary components for seed growth. We will treat outside surfaces of the chamber as other outside surfaces on the rover, wiped with a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and water as per Category IVb planetary protection requirements. All internal components of the MPX except the seeds and camera (including the water system, the plant growth stage and interior surface walls) will be sterilized by autoclave and subjected to sterilizing dry heat at a temperature of 125°C at an absolute humidity corresponding to a relative humidity of less than 25 percent referenced to the standard conditions of 0°C and 760 torr pressure. The seeds and internal compartments of the MPX in contact with the growth media will be assembled and tested to be free of viable microbes. MPX, once assembled, cannot survive Dry Heat Microbial Reduction. The camera with the radiation and CO2 sensors will be sealed in their own container and vented through HEPA filters. The seeds will be vernalized (microbe free) as per current Space Station methods described by Paul et al. 2001. Documentation of the lack of viable microbes on representative seeds from the same seed lot as used in the flight unit and lack of viable microbes in the interior of the MPX will be confirmed by the assay methods outlined in NASA HDBK 6022. In this method surfaces are swabbed and the cells collected on the swabs are extracted and then cultured following a standard protocol. All operations involving the manipulation of sterile items and sample processing shall be performed in laminar flow environments meeting Class 100 air cleanliness requirements of Federal Standard 209B. The entire MPX will be assembled in a sterile environment within a month of launch if possible, but could withstand an earlier assembly if required.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Fluvial channel belts, the deposits accumulated in rivers surrounded by floodplain deposits, are sensitive environmental recorders. Across Mars, wind has exposed ancient channel belts via the preferential erosion of floodplain strata, creating landforms called fluvial ridges. However, river deposits observed by the Mars rover Curiosity are instead exposed along a series of steep slopes and shallow benches, and short, truncated ridges we call noses. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these exposures record channel-belt exhumation with a preferential direction of scarp retreat (a slope-aspect control), in contrast with models of fluvial-ridge formation. Using a landscape evolution model sensitive to lithology and an Earth-analog 3D-seismic-reflectance volume imaging fluvial stratigraphy, we generated synthetic erosional landscapes where channel-belt exhumation created benches and noses rather than fluvial ridges, depending on the orientation of belts relative to the preferential direction of scarp retreat, which we suggest is set by winds steered along crater topography.',\n",

The program is called the Mars Rover Model Celebration (MRC). It focuses on students, teachers and parents in grades 3-8. Students design and build a model of a Mars rover to carry out a student selected science mission on the surface of Mars. A total of 195 Mars Rover teachers from the 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015 cohorts were invited to complete the Mars Rover Teacher Evaluation Survey. The survey was administered online and could be taken at the convenience of the participant. So far ~90 teachers have participated with responses still coming in. A total of 1300 students from the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 cohort were invited to submit brief self-assessments of their participation in the program. Teachers were asked to rate their current level of confidence in their ability to teach specific topics within the Earth and Life Science realms, as well as their confidence in their ability to implement teaching strategies with their students. The most striking increase in this area was the reported 48% of teachers who felt their confidence in teaching “Earth and the solar system and universe” increased “Quite a bit” as a result of their participation in the MRC program. The vast majority of teachers (86-100%) felt somewhat to very confident in their ability to effectively implement all of the listed teaching strategies. The most striking increases were the percentage of teachers who felt their confidence increased “Quite a bit” as a result of their participation in the MRC program in the following areas: “Getting students interested in and curious about science” (63%); “Teaching science as a co-inquirer with students” (56%); and “Continually find better ways to teach science” (59%). Student outcome analysis is pending correlation with final progress reports for the participating students. A key finding is that 354/365 responding students in the 2014-2015 cohort report substantial increase in science excitement owing to participation in the program.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Venus is one of the most challenging in-situ environments to explore. Despite these challenges, incredible progress has been made in recent years on long lived platforms using high temperature electronics. However, these platforms have very limited capabilities. The concept presented here takes those long lived, high temperature electronics, and provides them with a method for long duration sustained mobility on Venus. This opens up a number of opportunities for a Venus in-situ explorer, with one of the most compelling being obtaining samples from multiple geologic units across the surface of Venus. The Hybrid Automaton Rover-Venus (HAR-V) is a mission concept, which enables long duration in-situ mobility on the surface of Venus. An automaton is a mechanical device capable of performing a series of complex actions to achieve a specific result or a mechanical robot. Built of stainless steel and titanium, the automaton rover would reduce the requirements on electronics and requires minimal human interaction by focusing on a basic, robust capabilities. HAR-V would not be reliant on image processing and onboard navigation current Mars rovers use, as this cannot be done with available high-temperature electronics. Instead, the rover would physically sense the environment around it and use those inputs to navigate. Mobility requires a significant amount of power, so HAR-V would enable exploration of the Venus surface by directly collecting mechanical wind energy and transferring it to the mobility system. Keeping the energy in a mechanical state conserves ninety percent of the mechanical energy when compared to using a generator and electric motor. The Venus wind provides a low speed, high torque input, which is directly beneficial for mobility, which requires low speed, high torque. While the mobility system is mostly mechanical, the instruments, data collection, and data transmission would be done with basic silcon carbide and gallium nitride high temperature electronics. Humans could also provide basic path directions through a transceiver.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'We report the results of geological studies by the Opportunity Mars rover on the Endeavour Crater rim. Four major units occur in the region (oldest to youngest): the Matijevic, Shoemaker, Grasberg, and Burns formations. The Matijevic formation, consisting of fine-grained clastic sediments, is the only pre-Endeavour-impact unit and might be part of the Noachian etched units of Meridiani Planum. The Shoemaker formation is a heterogeneous polymict impact breccia; its lowermost member incorporates material eroded from the underlying Matijevic formation. The Shoemaker formation is a close analog to the Bunte Breccia of the Ries Crater, although the average clast sizes are substantially larger in the latter. The Grasberg formation is a thin, fine-grained, homogeneous sediment unconformably overlying the Shoemaker formation and likely formed as an airfall deposit of unknown areal extent. The Burns formation sandstone overlies the Grasberg, but compositions of the two units are distinct; there is no evidence that the Grasberg formation is a fine-grained subfacies of the Burns formation. The rocks along the Endeavour Crater rim were affected by at least four episodes of alteration in the Noachian and Early Hesperian: (i) vein formation and alteration of preimpact Matijevic formation rocks, (ii) low-water/rock alteration along the disconformity between the Matijevic and Shoemaker formations, (iii) alteration of the Shoemaker formation along fracture zones, and (iv) differential mobilization of Fe and Mn, and CaSO<SUB>4</SUB>-vein formation in the Grasberg and Shoemaker formations. Episodes (ii) and (iii) possibly occurred together, but (i) and (iv) are distinct from either of these.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The ESA/Roscosmos ExoMars rover will be launched in 2018. The primary aim of the mission will be to find evidence of extinct or extant life by extracting samples from the subsurface of Mars. The rover will incorporate a drill that is capable of extracting cores from depths of up to 2 m, a Sample Preparation and Distribution System (SPDS) that will crush the core into small grains and a suite of analytical instruments. A key component of the analytical suite will be the Raman Laser Spectrometer (RLS) that will be used to probe the molecular and mineralogical composition of the samples. In this work we consider the capability of the proposed Raman spectrometer to detect reduced carbon (possibly associated with evidence for extinct life) and to identify the level of thermal alteration/maturity. The Raman analysis of 21 natural samples of shale (originating from regions exhibiting different levels of thermal maturity) is described and it is shown that reduced carbon levels as low as 0.08% can be readily detected. It is also demonstrated that the Raman spectra obtained with the instrument can be used to distinguish between samples exhibiting high and low levels of thermal maturity and that reduced carbon can be detected in samples exposed to significant levels of oxidation (as expected on the surface of Mars).',\n",

This prototype is based on ASPEN, the Automated Scheduling and Planning Environment. This artificial intelligence (AI)-based planning and scheduling system will automatically generate a command sequence that will execute within resource constraints and satisfy flight rules. An automated planning and scheduling system encodes rover design knowledge and uses search and reasoning techniques to automatically generate low-level command sequences while respecting rover operability constraints, science and engineering preferences, environmental predictions, and also adhering to hard temporal constraints. This prototype planning system has been field-tested using the Rocky 7 rover at JPL and will be field-tested on more complex rovers to prove its effectiveness before transferring the technology to flight operations for an upcoming NASA mission. Enabling goal-driven commanding of planetary rovers greatly reduces the requirements for highly skilled rover engineering personnel. This in turn greatly reduces mission operations costs. In addition, goal-driven commanding permits a faster response to changes in rover state (e.g., faults) or science discoveries by removing the time-consuming manual sequence validation process, allowing rapid \"what-if\" analyses, and thus reducing overall cycle times.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"As of December 2008, the two Mars rover spacecraft Spirit and Opportunity have collected more than 4 years worth of data from nine imaging instruments producing greater than 200k images which includes both raw image data from spacecraft instruments and images generated by post-processing algorithms developed by NASA's Multimission Image Processing Laboratory (MIPL). This paper describes a prototype software system that allows scientists to browse and data-mine the images produced from NASA's Mars Exploratory Rover (MER) missions with emphasis on the automatic detection of images containing rocks that are of interest for geological research. We highlight two aspects of our prototype system: (1) software design for mining remote data repositories, (2) a computationally efficient image search engine for detecting MER images that containing rocks. Datatype abstractions made at the software design level allow users to access and visualize the source data through a single simple-to-use interface when the underlying data may originate from a local or remote image repository. Data mining queries into the MER image data are specified over chronological intervals denoted (sols) as each interval is a solar day. As in other mining applications, an automatic detection and classification algorithm is used to compute a relevance score that represents how relevant a given recorded image is to the user-specified query. Query results are presented as list of records, sorted by their relevance score, which the user may then visualize and investigate to extract information of interest. Several standard image analysis tools are provided for investigation of 2D images (e.g., histogram equalization, edge detection, etc.) and, when available, stereoscopic data is integrated with the image data using multiple windows which show both the 2D image and 3D surface geometry. The combination of data mining and a high-quality visualization interface provides MER researchers unprecedented access to the recorded data.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Mars has become the preeminent target of astrobiology due to its many Earth-like features. Serpentinized environments on Mars are increasingly of astrobiological interest because they imply the presence of several of the \"key elements\" for life. The Mars 2020 rover carries a compelling set of spectral instruments with the intent to characterize past habitable serpentinized environments, search for potential biosignatures, and collect samples for potential return to Earth. Reliable spectroscopic identification of serpentinization minerals is, of course, a prerequisite for mission accomplishment. The current assignment of spectroscopic features is based on the databases derived from pure minerals. However, many studies have confirmed that mineral assemblage can complicate spectrum identification, often leading to misinterpretation of the data. Therefore, a rock-based library should be built, which will increase our capability to interpret the Martian spectroscopic data. As such, we performed a comprehensive mineralogical and spectroscopic survey of several rocks sampled from an ophiolite complex in Qaidam Basin, one of the largest Mars analogs on Earth, to build an ophiolite spectral database. X-ray fluorescence (XRF), visible and near-infrared (VNIR), Raman spectroscopy, and XRD were used to identify minerals in the rocks. The results show that serpentine in the rocks with talc could be misinterpreted as sepiolite only relying on the Raman vibrations, while the VNIR spectra can identify serpentine well in all rocks. In addition, the camera and Raman spectrometer on the Mars rover should work together to identify different polymorphs of serpentine, i.e., antigorite, lizardite, and chrysotile. Raman and/or VNIR spectroscopy is effective for other minerals associated with serpentinization, including brucite, dolomite, magnesite, magnetite, talc, and quartz. Our study provides a framework for detecting serpentinization minerals on Mars with spectrometers and can be used for data interpretation by the Mars 2020 mission. All the spectral data presented in the supplementary material facilitate further comparison with future in situ and orbital measurements on Mars.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) provides chemical information from atomic, ionic, and molecular emissions from which geochemical composition can be deciphered. Analysis of LIBS spectra in cases where targets are observed at different distances, as is the case for the ChemCam instrument on the Mars rover Curiosity, which performs analyses at distances between 2 and 7.4 m is not a simple task. In our previous work we showed that spectral distance correction based on a proxy spectroscopic standard created from first-shot dust observations on Mars targets ameliorates the distance bias in multivariate-based elemental-composition predictions of laboratory data. In this work, we correct an expanded set of neutral and ionic spectral emissions for distance bias in the ChemCam data set. By using and testing different selection criteria to generate multiple proxy standards, we find a correction that minimizes the difference in spectral intensity measured at two different distances and increases spectral reproducibility. When the quantitative performance of distance correction is assessed, there is improvement for SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>, CaO, FeOT, Na<SUB>2</SUB>O, K<SUB>2</SUB>O, that is, for most of the major rock forming elements, and for the total major-element weight percent predicted. However, for MgO the method does not provide improvements while for TiO<SUB>2</SUB>, it yields inconsistent results. In addition, we have observed that many emission lines do not behave consistently with distance, evidenced from laboratory analogue measurements and ChemCam data. This limits the effectiveness of the method.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In order to select the most efficient kind of a martian exploring vehicle, the similarity criteria are deduced from the equilibrium movement in the terrestrial and martian conditions. Different invariants have been obtained for the existing (entry capsules, parachutes and rovers) and potential martian exploring vehicles (lighter-than-air vehicle, airplane, helicopter and Mars Jumper). These similarity criteria, as non dimensional numbers, allow to quickly compare if such a kind of vehicles can operate in the martian environment, the movement performances, the necessary geometrical dimensions and the power consumption. Following this way of study it was concluded what vehicle is most suitable for the near soil Mars exploration. \"Mars Rover\" has less power consumption on Mars, but due to the rugged terrain the performances are weak. A vacuumed rigid airship is possible to fly with high performances and endurance on Mars, versus the impossibility of such a machine on the Earth. Due to very low density and the low Reynolds numbers in the Mars atmosphere, the power consumption for the martian airplane or helicopter, is substantial higher. The most efficient vehicle for the Mars exploration it seems to be a machine using the in-situ non-chemical propellants: the 95% CO<SUB>2</SUB> atmosphere and the weak solar radiation. A small compressor, electrically driven by photovoltaics, compresses the gas in a storage tank, in time.

First, the results from Juno at Jupiter strongly support the concept of \"pebble\" accretion in the formation of planets, while New Horizon\\'s \"reveal\" of Ultima Thule puts strong constraints on how accretion occurs at the edge of a planetary system.

FREND is the neutron collimated telescope, which is capable to measure the prompt neutron radiation of Mars from the 400 km orbit with the spatial resolution of about 40 km. The flux of epithermal neutrons is known to depend on the content of water in the shallow subsurface about 1 meter, so such measurements could allow to study the ground water distribution with fine spatial resolution over the entire martian surface from 70 degrees of the north latitude down to 70 degree of the south latitude. The resolution of tens of km is necessary to characterize the particular relief features on the surface by the content of water in the soil. Such mapping data should resolve the water distribution within the Gale crater, which is necessary to explain the paradoxic difefrence between the estimated contents of water in this crater, as about 5% by HEND on the Mars Odyssy and the ground data about 2 -3 % by DAN on the Curiosity. Also, the FREND mapping data of the ground water should be useful for the landing site selection of future Mars rovers, such as ExoMars or Mars 2020.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"High precision topographic information is critical to many landing site geological and engineering applications. Precise navigation and localization of the Mars rover is important both for its own safety as well as for its ability to accomplish engineering and scientific objectives as it traverses the Martian surface. Thus high precision landing site mapping and rover localization is very desirable for the support of future long-range rover missions such as the 600-meter to 1,000-meter traverse planned for the 2003 MER mission. We have developed algorithms and software for the integrated bundle adjustment of ground images. An incremental bundle adjustment model has also been developed that adjusts descent and rover images in a progressive process that results in increased computational efficiency. An innovative approach has been investigated for automatic feature extraction and tie-point selection based on interesting point filtering and image matching techniques. Two field tests were conducted (April 1999 and May 2000) at Silver Lake, CA. Various rover localization experiments were carried out. Using descent and rover images and either an integrated or incremental adjustment, rover localization accuracy of one percent was achieved of about 1m for a traverse length of 1km from the landing center. Experiment results also showed that if no descent images are available (as will be the case in the 2003 MER mission), it is still feasible to localize a rover using only rover images. In addition to using simulated descent and rover images, we tested our methods and software with actual Mars data - IMP lander (Imager for Mars Pathfinder) and rover images form 1997 Mars pathfinder mission. With the bundle adjustment, the image errors were reduced from several - tens of pixels to a sub-pixel level. This indicates that the bundle adjustment has improved the exterior orientation (EO) parameters significantly. Seamless DEM and orthoimage can then be generated using the improved EO parameters. We are currently processing data from the Athena Science Team's FIDO test conducted in August 2002. In this test, MOC, THEMIS and MOLA data were simulated for the FIDO site and actual Navcam and Pancam images were taken. We will present the latest results at the meeting.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The detection of atmospheric methane on Mars implies an active methane source. This introduces the possibility of a biotic source with the implied need to determine whether the methane is indeed biotic in nature or geologically generated. There is a clear need for robotic algorithms which are capable of manoeuvring a rover through a methane plume on Mars to locate its source. We explore aspects of Mars methane plume modelling to reveal complex dynamics characterized by advection and diffusion. A statistical analysis of the plume model has been performed and compared to analyses of terrestrial plume models. Finally, we consider a robotic search strategy to find a methane plume source. We find that gradient-based techniques are ineffective, but that more sophisticated model-based search strategies are unlikely to be available in near-term rover missions.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) represents the first time that NASA is demonstrating In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) on the surface of another planetary body. MOXIE will produce oxygen from atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> on Mars. It is being developed for NASA's 2020 Mars Rover and will produce greater than 99.6% pure oxygen through solid oxide electrolysis. MOXIE is roughly 0.5% of the scale that would be necessary to produce oxygen for breathing and use as a propellant for a human Mars mission. <P />Tests are being performed on MOXIE in the laboratory at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At the same time, a model is being developed to simulate and predict the performance of MOXIE. The ability to predict the performance of MOXIE on Mars is a critical step in preparation for surface operations. Without the ability to estimate inefficient or unsafe operating conditions, MOXIE operations on Mars run a spectrum of risk ranging from loss of efficiency to the loss of the entire mission. Therefore, to predict performance and thus avoid subjecting flight hardware to unsafe conditions, a dynamic model has been developed that simulates MOXIE's operation. Simulink, a package contained within the MATLAB programming language, was chosen as a convenient way to build this dynamic representation of MOXIE. The model is a combination of theoretical and empirical values regarding the gas flows, thermal transfers, electrochemistry, and control loops that are representative of the true MOXIE system. The results of this model have been validated against data from JPL's MOXIE testbed laboratory. <P />This paper gives an overview of how MOXIE works and how it is modeled. MOXIE is the first instrument of its kind to leave the Earth, and the modeling of this instrument is similarly unique. As the dynamic model continues to evolve with new data, it becomes a fast and inexpensive way to test MOXIE without subjecting expensive hardware to hazardous conditions.\",\n",

It was found that the benefit of improved data to approach and encounter navigation was highly dependent on the a priori uncertainties assumed for several non-estimated parameters, including those for frame-tie, Earth orientation, troposphere delay, and station locations. With these errors at their current levels, navigational performance was found to be insensitive to enhancements in data accuracy. However, when expected improvements in these errors are modeled, performance with current-accuracy data significantly improves, with substantial further improvements possible with enhancements in data accuracy.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Mars exploration has become a hot spot in recent years and is still advancing rapidly. However, Mars has massive dust storms that may cover many areas of the planet and last for weeks or even months. The local/global dust storms are so influential that they can significantly reduce visibility, and thereby the images captured by the cameras on the Mars rover are degraded severely. This work presents an unsupervised Martian dust storm removal network via disentangled representation learning (DRL). The core idea of the DRL framework is to use the content encoder and dust storm encoder to disentangle the degraded images into content features (on domain-invariant space) and dust storm features (on domain-specific space). The dust storm features carry the full dust storm-relevant prior knowledge from the dust storm images. The \"cleaned\" content features can be effectively decoded to generate more natural, faithful, clear images. The primary advantages of this framework are twofold. First, it is among the first to perform unsupervised training in Martian dust storm removal with a single image, avoiding the synthetic data requirements. Second, the model can implicitly learn the dust storm-relevant prior knowledge from the real-world dust storm data sets, avoiding the design of the complicated handcrafted priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the DRL framework\\'s effectiveness and show the promising performance of our network for Martian dust storm removal.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Volcanism has been a dominant process on Mars, along with a pervasive global cryosphere. Therefore, the interaction between these two is considered likely. Terrestrial glaciovolcanism produces distinctive lithologies and alteration terrains, as well as hydrothermal environments that can be inhabited by microorganisms. Here, we provide a framework for identifying evidence of such glaciovolcanic environments during future Mars exploration, and provide a descriptive reference for active hydrothermal environments to be utilised for future astrobiological studies. Remote sensing data were combined with field observations and sample analysis that included X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, thin section petrography, scanning electron microscopy, electron dispersive spectrometer analysis, and dissolved water chemistry to characterise samples from two areas of basaltic glaciovolcanism: Askja and Kverkfjöll volcanoes in Iceland. The glaciovolcanic terrain between these volcanoes is characterised by subglacially-erupted fissure swarm ridges, which have since been modified by multiple glacial outburst floods. Active hydrothermal environments at Kverkfjöll include hot springs, anoxic pools, glacial meltwater lakes, and sulphur- and iron-depositing fumaroles, all situated within ice-bound geothermal fields. Temperatures range from 0 °C-94.4 °C, and aqueous environments are acidic-neutral (pH 2-7.5) and sulphate-dominated. Mineralogy of sediments, mineral crusts, and secondary deposits within basalts suggest two types of hydrothermal alteration: a low-temperature (&lt; 120 °C) assemblage dominated by nanophase palagonite, sulphates (gypsum, jarosite), and iron oxides (goethite, hematite); and a high-temperature (&gt; 120 °C) assemblage signified by zeolite (heulandite) and quartz. These mineral assemblages are consistent with those identified at the Martian surface. In-situ and laboratory VNIR (440-1000 nm) reflectance spectra representative of Mars rover multispectral imaging show sediment spectral profiles to be influenced by Fe<SUP>2 +/3 +</SUP>-bearing minerals, regardless of their dominant bulk mineralogy. Characterising these terrestrial glaciovolcanic deposits can help identify similar processes on Mars, as well as identifying palaeoenvironments that may once have supported and preserved life.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In January 2004, the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) mission successfully deployed two robotic geologists - Spirit and Opportunity - to opposite sides of the red planet. Onboard each rover is an array of cameras and scientific instruments that send data back to Earth, where ground-based systems process and store the information. During the height of the mission, a team of about 250 scientists and engineers worked around the clock to analyze the collected data, determine a strategy and activities for the next day and then carefully compose the command sequences that would instruct the rovers in how to perform their tasks. The scientists and engineers had to work closely together to balance the science objectives with the engineering constraints so that the mission achieved its goals safely and quickly. To accomplish this coordinated effort, they adhered to a tightly orchestrated schedule of meetings and processes. To keep on time, it was critical that all team members were aware of what was happening, knew how much time they had to complete their tasks, and could easily access the information they need to do their jobs. Computer scientists and software engineers at NASA Ames Research Center worked closely with the mission managers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to create applications that support the mission. One such application, the Collaborative Information Portal (CIP), helps mission personnel perform their daily tasks, whether they work inside mission control or the science areas at JPL, or in their homes, schools, or offices. With a three-tiered, service-oriented architecture (SOA) - client, middleware, and data repository - built using Java and commercial software, CIP provides secure access to mission schedules and to data and images transmitted from the Mars rovers. This services-based approach proved highly effective for building distributed, flexible applications, and is forming the basis for the design of future mission software systems. Almost two years after the landings on Mars, the rovers are still going strong, and CIP continues to provide data access to mission personnel.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In Mars exploration missions, it is crucial for rovers to identify and locate target rocks for autonomous sampling. The rock sampling of rovers relies on the deep learning-based rock detection algorithms of rovers. However, the navigation camera of rover often has problems such as motion blur and defocus blur. The object detection algorithm cannot accurately detect the pixels of the sampling target, which causes the rover manipulator to malfunction and damage the end drill bit. In this work, we try to solve this problems by developing a deep learning network, dubbed the Mars Rover Instance Segmentation Network (MRISNet). First, the generative adversarial networks are used to mitigate image degradation caused by blur and improve the clarity of image texture. Then, we use the attention mechanism and the feature pyramid structure to improve the residual network so that the extracted feature maps have rich semantic information. We use simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) to group similar pixels in the feature map and replace a large number of pixels with a small number of superpixels to make the segmentation more refined. Experimental results show that compared with the semantic segmentation algorithm, the proposed MRISNet algorithm achieves an Average Precision of 76.8 and a better segmentation on Martian rock images.',\n",

In this paper, we investigate the effect of the net charges carried by dust particles on the radiative properties of Martian dust. We find that net charges carried by dust particles significantly alter the extinction properties and single scattering albedo of dust at thermal infrared radiation band, which results in an enhancement of the infrared heating rate, up to 6.36%. We show that the discrepancy between the atmospheric temperature predicted by the Mars Atmosphere Model and the one detected during the Mars rover landing is reduced to within 11% when the effect of the net charges carried by the dust is considered. Therefore, it is essential to consider the effect of the net charges carried by dust particles for an accurate characterization of the atmospheric temperature.',\n",

These fully autonomous machines are not only roving geologists and geochemists but they have many other hobbies from meteorology to hypersonic pilotry. Lack of computation and energy availability have proved to be key obstacles that ultimately limit the Mars rover capabilties over what can be achieved terrestrially. Fortunately technologies such as structured light, visual odometry, map hazard avoidance, autonomous feature and motion detection and many others have provided the means to successfully overcome these obstacles.

       "    'abstract': \"China's first Mars rover, Zhurong, has carried out an exploration mission in southern Utopian Planitia. As rocks and their three-dimensional (3D) morphology are essential for studying the geological characteristics of the Martian surface, this paper presents an approach for automatically extracting 3D rocks from stereo rover images. With our approach, 6,185 cm-scale rocks are extracted using the Zhurong NaTeCam images, with the F<SUB>1</SUB>-score achieving 91.86%. Approximate 3D morphological features are then calculated for each rock, and the statistical result shows that small rocks in centimeters make up the majority. Comparative morphological analyses of rocks in different areas show that landscape type affects the number of rocks but has no clear relationship to the proportions of rocks of different sizes. The outcrops of sedimentary rocks, the predominant type of rocks in the Zhurong landing area, and the float rocks are distributed differently regarding all morphological features, making the size-frequency distribution of rocks around craters significantly different from other areas. Further comparative analysis with the Bonneville crater ejecta rocks extracted from the Spirit rover data is also conducted. Some similarities between the Zhurong outcrop rocks and the Bonneville crater ejecta rocks are found in 2D compactness. Meanwhile, the Bonneville crater ejecta rocks have a more scattered distribution in sphericity than both the float and outcrop rocks in the Zhurong landing area, indicating that the shapes of the Bonneville crater ejecta rocks may be more diverse. In addition, the sphericity is found to converge with height for rocks in both landing areas.\",\n",

This allows to employ a suspension-based mechanism which distributes the automobile ton as consistently as you possibly can actually on protrusions as well as unusual surfaces. The look involves a springtime totally free suspension dependent differential drive process which enables the bogie to go more than rubble, pebbles easily. The cameras and sensors installed on a rover should be healthy to function also and properly to increase the life spam of theirs. Additional vibrations as well as jerks result in quicker damage within receptors, circuit boards as well as digital cameras. The rocker bogie mechanism was created trying to keep this particular of brain by offering optimum stableness in all of the terrains. As a result, we examine the layout and also fabrication on the rocker bogie mechanism by fabrication of this particular basic surfaces automobile making use of ideas of the bogie mechanism. All-terrain movable robots are totally different from some other standard movable robots, since they think about the impact of unstructured surface and the environment of its. Thus, the robots are created to work efficiently on all-natural terrains which could be sloped, difficult, as well as deformable and therefore are utilized within these kinds of areas as serious room exploration brilliance as well as recovery as well as army. The rocker bogie suspension product is a passive spring less as well as symmetric mechanism. Each and every edge on the rocker bogie carries a bogie and a rocker: the rocker is attached to the back-steering wheel, and also the center steering wheel as well as the forward steering wheel are linked with the bogie. The 2 sides of the paper of rocker bogie are linked through the differential bar linked to the primary body, and this guarantees the 6 wheels will be in exposure to the soil constantly giving a steady wedge just for the systematic tools &amp; receptors. The rocker arm as well as bogie are built by using various PVC and PVC pipes perspective pipe as well as for interconnecting all of the arms, we're consuming SHM strip with appropriate fastened.

Measurements of JMDS-1 dust simulant show that JMDS-1 has a bulk composition, mineralogy, reflectance spectra, and particle characteristics similar to the Martian dust detected by Mars rovers. In addition, we measured the thermal conductivity of dust simulant, soil simulant, and dust-soil simulant mixtures under simulated Martian conditions (i.e., -30°C; 500-1,000 Pa). The results reveal that the micro-sized dust simulant has a thermal conductivity of ∼0.015 W/mK, which is two times lower than the thermal conductivity of sub-millimeter sized soil simulant (i.e., ∼0.035 W/mK). This implies that the dust layer on Mars seems to play a significant role to change the thermal properties of surface materials.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Risk to human astronauts and interplanetary distance causing slow and limited communication drives scientists to pursue an autonomous approach to exploring distant planets, such as Mars. A portion of exploration of Mars has been conducted through the autonomous collection and analysis of Martian data by spacecraft such as the Mars rovers and the Mars Express Orbiter. The autonomy used on these Mars exploration spacecraft and on Earth to analyze data collected by these vehicles mainly consist of machine learning, a field of artificial intelligence where algorithms collect data and self-improve with the data. Additional applications of machine learning techniques for Mars exploration have potential to resolve communication limitations and human risks of interplanetary exploration. In addition, analyzing Mars data with machine learning has the potential to provide a greater understanding of Mars in numerous domains such as its climate, atmosphere, and potential future habitation. To explore further utilizations of machine learning techniques for Mars exploration, this paper will first summarize the general features and phenomena of Mars to provide a general overview of the planet, elaborate upon uncertainties of Mars that would be beneficial to explore and understand, summarize every current or previous usage of machine learning techniques in the exploration of Mars, explore implementations of machine learning that will be utilized in future Mars exploration missions, and explore machine learning techniques used in Earthly domains to provide solutions to the previously described uncertainties of Mars.',\n",

In a unique collaboration, the departments of Physics (ECE) and Psychology at the University of Houston have teamed up with NASA in a grant to develop a supplemental curriculum for elementary (G3-5) and middle school (G6-8) science teachers called Mars Rover. During this six week project, students work in teams to research the solar system, the planet Mars, design a research mission to Mars, and create a model Mars Rover to carry out this mission. Targeted Language Arts skills are embedded in each lesson so that students acquire the requisite academic vocabulary and research skills to enable them to successfully design their Mars Rover. Students learn academic and scientific vocabulary using scientifically based reading research. They receive direct instruction in research techniques, note-taking, summarizing, writing and other important language skills. The interdisciplinary collaboration empowers students as readers, writers and scientists. After the curriculum is completed, a culminating Mars Rover event is held at a local university, bringing students teams in contact with real-life scientists who critique their work, ask questions, and generate excite about STEM careers. Students have the opportunity to showcase their Mars Rover and to orally demonstrate their knowledge of Mars. Students discover the excitement of scientific research, STEM careers, important research and writing tools in a practical, real-life setting.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Future human missions to Mars are expected to emphasize scientific exploration. While recent Mars rover missions have addressed a wide range of science objectives, human extravehicular activities (EVAs), including the Apollo missions, have had limited experience with science operations. Current EVAs are carefully choreographed and guided continuously from Earth with negligible delay in communications between crew and flight controllers. Future crews on Mars will be expected to achieve their science objectives while operating and coordinating with a science team back on Earth under communication latency and bandwidth restrictions. The BASALT (Biologic Analog Science Associated with Lava Terrains) research program conducted Mars analog science on Earth to understand the concept of operations and capabilities needed to support these new kinds of EVAs. A suite of software tools (Minerva) was used for planning and executing all BASALT EVAs, supporting text communication across communication latency, and managing the collection of operational and scientific EVA data. This paper describes the support capabilities provided by Minerva to cope with various geospatial and temporal constraints to support the planning and execution phases of the EVAs performed during the BASALT research program. The results of this work provide insights on software needs for future science-driven planetary EVAs.',\n",

As biosignatures could be preserved in the Martian mineral record, Mars analogue environments on Earth also provide useful points of reference for measurements gathered by Mars rover missions. One of the best Martian Analogue Environments on Earth is the dry high-altitude desert in the area of the Ojos del Salado volcano in Chile. The Ojos del Salado is the highest point of the Puna de Atacama plateau in the Andes, characterized by extremely dry periglacial conditions, high UV radiation levels, low oxygen pressure, strong winds and the presence of volcanic and hydrothermal activity. High altitude lakes in the area feature polyextremophile microbial ecosystems that are adapted to these unique conditions and which provide a valuable insight into ecosystems that might resemble life on Early Mars.

       "    'abstract': 'The Canadian Space Agency (CSA), through its Analogue Missions program, supported a microrover-based analogue mission designed to simulate a Mars rover mission geared toward identifying and characterizing methane emissions on Mars. The analogue mission included two, progressively more complex, deployments in open-pit asbestos mines where methane can be generated from the weathering of olivine into serpentine: the Jeffrey mine deployment (June 2011) and the Norbestos mine deployment (June 2012). At the Jeffrey Mine, testing was conducted over 4 days using a modified off-the-shelf Pioneer rover and scientific instruments including Raman spectrometer, Picarro methane detector, hyperspectral point spectrometer and electromagnetic induction sounder for testing rock and gas samples. At the Norbestos Mine, we used the research Kapvik microrover which features enhanced autonomous navigation capabilities and a wider array of scientific instruments. This paper describes the rover operations in terms of planning, deployment, communication and equipment setup, rover path parameters and instrument performance. Overall, the deployments suggest that a search strategy of “follow the methane” is not practical given the mechanisms of methane dispersion. Rather, identification of features related to methane sources based on image tone/color and texture from panoramic imagery is more profitable.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Images from two sensors, the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) and the Context Camera (CTX), both on-board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), were used to generate high-quality DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) of the Martian surface. However, there were discrepancies between the DEMs generated from the images acquired by these two sensors due to various reasons, such as variations in boresight alignment between the two sensors during the flight in the complex environment. This paper presents a systematic investigation of the discrepancies between the DEMs generated from the HiRISE and CTX images. A combined adjustment algorithm is presented for the co-registration of HiRISE and CTX DEMs. Experimental analysis was carried out using the HiRISE and CTX images collected at the Mars Rover landing site and several other typical regions. The results indicated that there were systematic offsets between the HiRISE and CTX DEMs in the longitude and latitude directions. However, the offset in the altitude was less obvious. After combined adjustment, the offsets were eliminated and the HiRISE and CTX DEMs were co-registered to each other. The presented research is of significance for the synergistic use of HiRISE and CTX images for precision Mars topographic mapping.',\n",

The project focuses on Forbush decreases (FDs) in the galactic cosmic ray flux, which can be used as one of the \"signatures\" of an ICME passage. An analytical diffusion-expansion FD model was developed that is based on the widely used approach of an initially empty, closed magnetic structure (i.e. flux rope) that fills up slowly with particles by perpendicular diffusion. Remote CME observations and 3D reconstruction is used to constrain initial and boundary conditions. CME evolutionary properties are taken into account by incorporating the flux rope expansion. Several options of flux rope expansion are regarded as competing mechanism to diffusion, which can lead to different FD characteristics.

The ability to bore a 10 m deep hole will allow several important Mars exploration objectives to be addressed. These include the determination of the chemical composition of soil and rock below the surface, the identification of subsurface H2O, and the advancement of technology for drilling more deeply into the Martian regolith. Our design derives from technologies used in terrestrial boring operations and is based on extensive industrial drilling experience. The open borehole will allow for the insertion of sensing probes to observe stratigraphy and determine the chemical and elemental composition of the subsurface. The device will also allow surface instrumentation to study the cuttings extracted and volatiles released during the drilling process. When observed with the proper instrumentation, these downhole and top side measurements can identify the presence of water and organic compounds, as well as other geochemically important materials, as a precise function of depth below the Martian surface.',\n",

The objectives of the mission are to better understand the origin and evolution of Mars, to search for evidence of former life, and to improve the knowledge of the Martian environment in preparation for subsequent human exploration. Having formed in a different part of the Solar System from Earth, Mars will provide clues that will better enable the discrimination between conflicting theories of Solar System formations. Mars is also a natural laboratory on which a wide range of geologic and meteorological processes have operated under conditions very different from those on Earth. Samples are needed so that the full range of analytical techniques available here on Earth can be applied to the study of these issues. The rover provides the mobility needed to access different materials, and can be equipped with an analytical capability so that the planet can be sampled intelligently. The rover will also provide the means of exploring the planet on a human scale and performing a wide range of in situ measurements at different locations. Different mission scenarios are currently being studied with the goal of achieveing sample return before the end of the century.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Mars rovers and orbiters currently collect far more data than can be downlinked to Earth, which reduces mission science return; this problem will be exacerbated by future rovers of enhanced capabilities and lifetimes. We are developing onboard intelligence sufficient to extract geologically meaningful data from spectrometer measurements of soil and rock samples, and thus to guide the selection, measurement and return of these data from significant targets at Mars. Here we report on techniques to construct mineral detectors capable of running on current and future rover and orbital hardware. We focus on carbonate and sulfate minerals which are of particular geologic importance because they can signal the presence of water and possibly life. Sulfates have also been discovered at the Eagle and Endurance craters in Meridiani Planum by the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Opportunity and at other regions on Mars by the OMEGA instrument aboard Mars Express. We have developed highly accurate artificial neural network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based detectors capable of identifying calcite (CaCO3) and jarosite (KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6) in the visible/NIR (350-2500 nm) spectra of both laboratory specimens and rocks in Mars analogue field environments. To train the detectors, we used a generative model to create 1000s of linear mixtures of library end-member spectra in geologically realistic percentages. We have also augmented the model to include nonlinear mixing based on Hapke's models of bidirectional reflectance spectroscopy. Both detectors perform well on the spectra of real rocks that contain intimate mixtures of minerals, rocks in natural field environments, calcite covered by Mars analogue dust, and AVIRIS hyperspectral cubes. We will discuss the comparison of ANN and SVM classifiers for this task, technical challenges (weathering rinds, atmospheric compositions, and computational complexity), and plans for integration of these detectors into both the Coupled Layer Architecture for Robotic Autonomy (CLARAty) system and the Onboard Autonomous Science Investigation System (OASIS) at JPL.\",\n",

Our algorithms perform visual servoing on an elevation map instead of image features, because the latter are subject to abrupt scale changes during the approach.

       "    'abstract': 'The selection of landing sites for landers or rover missions to planetary bodies often requires a detailed mapping of various potential dangers in large amounts of satellite imagery, a time consuming and inefficient process. We leverage machine learning to accurately and efficiently identify and classify landing site dangers across the surface of Mars using NASA mission imagery, including HiRISE images. Landing site dangers generally include obstructions and jagged topography, such as: small craters, large crater rims, rocks, boulders, dunes, cliffs, and fractures. Based on the spatial density and distribution of these dangers, we can quickly assess and rank the safety of potential landing sites within satellite imagery. Future steps include the application of this analysis to other planetary bodies and to in situ analysis of videos taken by drones in Mars-analog environments. In future Mars missions, drones may be used as scouts to aid in the determination of the best path for Mars rovers during the mission. Using machine learning, we hope to identify obstacles, hazards, and science targets in situ and aid in the assessment of the safest and most scientifically useful rover exploration paths in real time. We break this problem of landing site identification and obstacle avoidance into multiple well-known computer vision tasks: image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. We will apply state-of-the-art image classification models like ResNext [<A href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431</A>], efficient real-time video detection models like YOLOv3 [<A href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767</A>] to detect objects, and Gated-SCNN (<A href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05740v1\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05740v1</A>) for semantic segmentation. Finally, we will describe how we combine all these models into an end-to-end machine learning system that can be deployed on the drone and/or rover.',\n",

Alluvium partially filling the main channel likely reflects effects of increasing aridity and bed load combined with less frequent, flashier precipitation. In contrast to defining channel margins, radar data do not indicate subtle stratigraphic changes in bedding related to fluvial aggradation, but do highlight local reflections likely corresponding to relict alluvial bedforms.

Various techniques allow scientists to extract detailed information about the Martian atmosphere from low level measurements taken during the different mission to Mars. One of the techniques used to extract atmospheric information from the Mars Rovers is to analyze the data that was obtained by the Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) onboard each of the Rovers during the Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) phase of each mission. Atmospheric entry profiles provide very detailed information about the atmosphere in very specific locations, while data collected by other means than direct entry is less detailed, but usually covers a larger planetary region. Combining information from these various sources will allow some fine tuning to atmospheric thermodynamic models, which will in turn improve predictions made by the models.

To a large extent, this is a costly and time-consuming manual process. Meanwhile, traditional optimal search algorithms (A∗ and Dijkstra) can search for a globally optimal path, but the path found does not satisfy the nonholonomic constraint of the vehicle, thus not directly drivable. The Terrain Classification-based Rover Traverse Planner (TCRTP), introduced in this article, is an automated algorithm that uses deep learning-based terrain classification as the guide to generate the optimal traverses with kinematic constraints. TCRTP combines the terrain classification with nonholonomic constraints, and it can quickly and accurately obtain the global optimal solution under the heuristic function. We also propose modifications of the cost function for path optimization to improve the smoothness of the solution. This algorithm plans forward and reverse movement, and penalizes reverse driving and changing the direction of movement. The TCRTP algorithm is easy to be extended, and the optimization traversal under multiple missions can be realized by adding traffic constraints, such as terrain roughness, elevation changes and so on. The TCRTP-based rover allows for real-time and frequent planning, and the addition of terrain constraints ensures the safety of the planned route. Our planner, combined with computer vision, shows the potential to reduce operator workloads and explore future planetary space.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The source of Martian atmospheric methane is unknown. On Earth, hydrothermal mineral deposits contain ancient methane together with a host of chemical and geological lines of evidence for the mechanism of gas production. Such deposits are therefore potentially attractive sampling sites on Mars. In order to evaluate this potential, hydrothermal calcite veins were sampled across the Caithness region of Scotland and analysed for methane by an incremental-crushing mass spectrometry technique that may be adaptable to Mars rovers. Methane was detected in all samples. Variations in the quantity of methane released were found to relate directly to the geological history of the localities. Calcite particle size was found to affect measurements in a systematic and informative way. Oxidative weathering had no discernable effect on methane recoverability. These results suggest that the technique is sensitive and informative enough to deserve consideration for missions to Mars.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"This work proposes a spectral convolutional neural network (CNN) operating on laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) signals to learn to (1) disentangle spectral signals from the sources of sensor uncertainty (i.e., pre-process) and (2) get qualitative and quantitative measures of chemical content of a sample given a spectral signal (i.e., calibrate). Once the spectral CNN is trained, it can accomplish either task through a single feed-forward pass, with real-time benefits and without any additional side information requirements including dark current, system response, temperature and detector-to-target range. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing approaches used by the Mars Science Lab for pre-processing and calibration for remote sensing observations from the Mars rover, 'Curiosity'.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Mars 2020 Perseverance rover is equipped with a next-generation engineering camera imaging system that represents an upgrade over previous Mars rover missions. These upgrades will improve the operational capabilities of the rover with an emphasis on drive planning, robotic arm operation, instrument operations, sample caching activities, and documentation of key events during entry, descent, and landing (EDL). There are a total of 16 cameras in the Perseverance engineering imaging system, including 9 cameras for surface operations and 7 cameras for EDL documentation. There are 3 types of cameras designed for surface operations: Navigation cameras (Navcams, quantity 2), Hazard Avoidance Cameras (Hazcams, quantity 6), and Cachecam (quantity 1). The Navcams will acquire color stereo images of the surface with a 96<SUP>∘</SUP>×73<SUP>∘</SUP> field of view at 0.33 mrad/pixel. The Hazcams will acquire color stereo images of the surface with a 136<SUP>∘</SUP>×102<SUP>∘</SUP> at 0.46 mrad/pixel. The Cachecam, a new camera type, will acquire images of Martian material inside the sample tubes during caching operations at a spatial scale of 12.5 microns/pixel. There are 5 types of EDL documentation cameras: The Parachute Uplook Cameras (PUCs, quantity 3), the Descent stage Downlook Camera (DDC, quantity 1), the Rover Uplook Camera (RUC, quantity 1), the Rover Descent Camera (RDC, quantity 1), and the Lander Vision System (LVS) Camera (LCAM, quantity 1). The PUCs are mounted on the parachute support structure and will acquire video of the parachute deployment event as part of a system to characterize parachute performance. The DDC is attached to the descent stage and pointed downward, it will characterize vehicle dynamics by capturing video of the rover as it descends from the skycrane. The rover-mounted RUC, attached to the rover and looking upward, will capture similar video of the skycrane from the vantage point of the rover and will also acquire video of the descent stage flyaway event. The RDC, attached to the rover and looking downward, will document plume dynamics by imaging the Martian surface before, during, and after rover touchdown. The LCAM, mounted to the bottom of the rover chassis and pointed downward, will acquire 90<SUP>∘</SUP>×90<SUP>∘</SUP> FOV images during the parachute descent phase of EDL as input to an onboard map localization by the Lander Vision System (LVS). The rover also carries a microphone, mounted externally on the rover chassis, to capture acoustic signatures during and after EDL. The Perseverance rover launched from Earth on July 30th, 2020, and touchdown on Mars is scheduled for February 18th, 2021.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"ExoMars is the European Space Agency (ESA) mission to Mars planned for launch in 2018, focusing on exobiology with the primary objective of searching for any traces of extant or extinct carbon-based micro-organisms. The on-surface mission is performed by a near-autonomous mobile robotic vehicle (also referred to as the rover) with a mission design life of 180 sols. The rover has a 6 × 6 × 6 with 6 wheel-walking drive configuration (all 6 wheels are driven, steered and have a 'walking' capability) and has flexible wheels providing enhanced traction compared to rigid wheels of the same diameter. The suspension is a passive '3-bogie' system which offers the same 6 wheel contact on uneven ground and mobility performance as the NASA-JPL 'rocker-bogie' suspension used on previous Mars rovers, but permits elimination of the differential linkage present in that design. Mars presents several challenges to the rover locomotion subsystem with its rock-strewn surface, sand dunes, rocky outcrops, craters and slopes. The unknown nature of the terrain to be traversed imposes several constraints on the locomotion subsystem design that need to be evaluated and incorporated within the flight model for its successful operation on Mars. In addition, accommodation within the confines of the lander and successful egress from it over deflated airbags places stringent constraints on locomotion subsystem mass, stowage envelope, deployment and wheel design. This paper documents the evolution of the ExoMars rover vehicle locomotion configuration from an early design concept to the current mission baseline design. The discussion involves various tradeoffs supported by mechanical and terramechanical analyses, simulations and testing performed on full-scale locomotion breadboard models at single wheel level and system level.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on the Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity rover began making detailed measurements of the cosmic ray and energetic particle radiation environment on the surface of Mars on 7 August 2012. We report and discuss measurements of the absorbed dose and dose equivalent from galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles on the martian surface for ~300 days of observations during the current solar maximum. These measurements provide insight into the radiation hazards associated with a human mission to the surface of Mars and provide an anchor point with which to model the subsurface radiation environment, with implications for microbial survival times of any possible extant or past life, as well as for the preservation of potential organic biosignatures of the ancient martian environment.\",\n",

Sufficiently slowing a lander in the thin air requires plenty of sophisticated kit, including designer heat shields, powerful retrorockets, and, sometimes, giant airbags. But the European-Russian ExoMars mission is struggling with a bit of technology that hails from the 18th century: parachutes. High-altitude tests earlier this year revealed that ExoMars's chutes were tearing as they were pulled from their bags. The European Space Agency has turned to NASA colleagues for help, and this week, a joint team begins tests to see whether redesigned bags and chutes now work, and if not, why. It could be their last chance to fix the problem and preserve a launch scheduled for July 2020—or face another 2 years of delay.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Solar System Exploration Committee of the NASA Advisory Council has recommended that a Mars Rover/Sample Return mission be launched before the year 2000. The recommendation is consistent with the science objectives as outlined by the National Academy of Sciences committees on Planetary and Lunar Exploration, and Planetary Biology and Chemical Evolution. Interest has also focused on Mars Rover/Sample Return (MRSR) missions, because of their crucial role as precursors for human exploration. As a result of this consensus among the advisory groups, a study of an MRSR mission began early in 1987. The study has the following goals: (1) to assess the technical feasibility of the mission; (2) to converge on two or three options for the general architecture of the mission; (3) to determine what new technologies need to be developed in order to implement the mission; (4) to define the different options sufficiently well that preliminary cost estimates can be made; and (5) to better define the science requirements. This chapter briefly describes Mars Rover/Sample Return missions that were examined in the late 1980s. These missions generally include a large (1000 kg) rover and return of over 5 kg of sample.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'We have developed and field-tested a technique to identify and characterize the source of an effluent plume (biogenic or otherwise) on Mars, using a slow-moving vehicle like a Mars Rover. The technique is based on terrestrial plume characterization methods (EPA Method 33a), and uses puff models of variable complexity to predict the plume behavior for a given source. The technique is developed assuming that a Mars Rover would be equipped with a high-performance eddy-sensing 3-D anemometer (e.g., a Martian Sonic Anemometer), as well as a fast-response tracer molecule-specific sensor (e.g., a TLS methane sensor). The platform is assumed to move only once a day, but have the ability to observe throughout the day and night. Data obtained from any one sol while the effluent plume meanders across the rover can be used to estimate the azimuth, range and strength of the source, but combining observations from multiple sols and locations is used to improve the estimate of the souce location and strength.We have conducted preliminary field tests using a Sonic Anemometer (Gill and Campbell) and fast-response methane sensors (LICOR and Picarro) on mobile platforms using both controlled and existing methane releases to prove our algorithm in simple terrain, and with varying atmospheric stability. We will discuss our results and the efficacy of our algorithm in real world conditions.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The last decade of Martian surface exploration has increased knowledge of the composition and variability of minerals present in the regolith and bedrock. This informs planning for manned missions to Mars for which these surface materials may be an important in-situ resource in agricultural applications. Soil on Mars is known to contain the majority of planet essential nutrients, but many questions of both the benefits (e.g. bioavailability of present nutrients) and limitations (e.g. extent of toxins) of Martian soil as a plant growth medium remain unanswered. It may be necessary to augment Mars soil with other regolith and bedrock materials (e.g. phyllosilicates, carbonates) to produce a medium appropriate for plant growth. A better understanding of the feasibility of using Mars soil as a plant growth medium could be accomplished with methods common to agricultural practices on Earth (e.g. biofertilization) using appropriate regolith and bedrock simulants as a plant growth medium. The study herein discusses the development of five new regolith and bedrock simulants. These simulants are designed to reflect several mineralogical (e.g. phyllosilicate clays) and chemical characteristics of various Mars surface materials that are most relevant to establishing the potential and limitations of these materials as in-situ resources for agricultural applications. The use of simulants provides a test bed for studies examining the potential of Mars' regolith and bedrock in agricultural applications, understanding data gaps surrounding these materials that will need further characterization, and methods to then conduct needed characterization of true Martian-regolith and bedrock in-situ. The simulants discussed herein are analyzed by X-ray diffraction using Reitveld refinement, X-ray fluorescence, V/NIR reflectance spectroscopy, and <SUP>57</SUP>Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy and then compared to equivalent published data available from Mars rover and orbiter missions. The resulting simulants are chemically and mineralogically comparable to Martian regolith and bedrock and reflect data particularly relevant for growing plants on Mars. The developed simulants are relevant for analogue plant growth studies and fertility measurements that may inform hypothesis, habitat design, and mission plans which involve using Martian soil as a plant growth medium.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A combined inelastic (Raman) and elastic (Mie-Rayleigh) scattering and Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) active remote sensing (RLIF) system is proposed as a mast-mounted instrument for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). This remote RLIF system will be capable of reconnaissance and identification of mineral, organic, and biogenic materials as well as conducting atmospheric studies of Mars. This system is based on the prototypes developed with partial support from NASA at the University of Hawaii. The proposed RLIF system will perform active optical imaging and spectroscopy out to 100 m on the surface features. In the elastic backscattering mode, the range of RLIF can be extended to &gt;5-km because the cross section of Mie-Rayleigh scattering is several orders of magnitude higher than that of Raman cross-sections of molecular species. Results obtained with the University of Hawaii\"s portable remote Raman and LIF system and the portable Mie-Rayleigh prototype lidar are presented. With the remote Raman system, measurements of mineral calcite (CaCO<SUB>3</SUB>), liquid hydrocarbons and solid naphthalene polycrystals have been verified to 100 m range. The LIF sensor will provide near real time in situ remote data that will complement analytical laboratory and contact suite instrumentation on the Mars rover.',\n",

The soils consist of fine-grained basaltic sand and a surface lag of hematite-rich spherules, spherule fragments, and other granules. Wind ripples are common. Underlying the thin soil layer, and exposed within small impact craters and troughs, are flat-lying sedimentary rocks. These rocks are finely laminated, are rich in sulfur, and contain abundant sulfate salts. Small-scale cross-lamination in some locations provides evidence for deposition in flowing liquid water. We interpret the rocks to be a mixture of chemical and siliciclastic sediments formed by episodic inundation by shallow surface water, followed by evaporation, exposure, and desiccation. Hematite-rich spherules are embedded in the rock and eroding from them. We interpret these spherules to be concretions formed by postdepositional diagenesis, again involving liquid water.',\n",

The term conventional refers to the methodologies, tools and approaches typically adopted in engineering that are applied to such missions. Presented is a \"conventional\" Mars rover mission in which the author was involved - ExoMars - into which is interspersed references to examples where biomimetic approaches may yield superior capabilities. Biomimetics is a relatively recently active area of research which seeks to examine how biological systems solve the problem of survival in the natural environment. Biological organisms are autonomous entities that must survive in a hostile world adapting both adaptivity and robustness. It is not then surprising that biomimetics is particularly useful when applied to robotic elements of a Mars exploration mission. I present a number of areas in which biomimetics may yield new solutions to the problem of Mars exploration - optic flow navigation, potential field navigation, genetically-evolved neuro-controllers, legged locomotion, electric motors implementing muscular behaviour, and a biomimetic drill based on the wood wasp ovipositor. Each of these techniques offers an alternative approach to conventional ones. However, the perceptive hurdles are likely to dwarf the technical hurdles in implementing many of these methods in the near future.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Geologic and climatologic studies suggest that conditions on early Mars were similar to early Earth. Because life on Earth is believed to have originated during this early period (3.5 billion years ago), the Martian environment could have also been conducive to the origin of life. To investigate this possibility we must first define the attributes of an early Martian biota. Then, specific geographic locations on Mars must be chosen where life may have occurred (i.e. areas which had long standing water), and within these distinct locations search for key signatures or bio-markers of a possible extinct Martian biota. Some of the key signatures or bio-markers indicative of past biological activity on Earth may be applicable to Mars including: reduced carbon and nitrogen compounds, CO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>2-</SUP>, SO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>2-</SUP>, NO<SUB>3-</SUB>, NO<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>, Mg, Mn, Fe, and certain other metals, and the isotopic ratios of C, N and S. However, we must also be able to distinguish abiotic from biologic origins for these bio-markers. For example, abiotically fixed N<SUB>2</SUB> would form deposits of NO<SUB>3-</SUB> and NO<SUB>2-</SUB>, whereas biological processes would have reduced these to ammonium containing compounds, N<SUB>2</SUB>O, or N<SUB>2</SUB>, which would then be released to the atmosphere. A fully equipped Mars Rover might be able to perform analyses to measure most of these biomarkers while on the Martian surface.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Navigation and Terrain Camera of Tianwen-1 Mars Rover is mainly used for the guidance, navigation and control of the Mars rover, and it will also be used for scientific research works.Due to the complexity of the working environment of the Mars rover, its optical imaging system is easily affected by stray light, which forms stray light radiation on the image plane, thus reducing the imaging quality and affecting the accuracy of navigation. In this paper, the variation of irradiance of image plane with incident angle in camera field of view is studied, and the irradiance distribution of each lens surface is compared and analyzed. Combined with the principle of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), the reason of irradiance variation law is analyzed. Referring to the results of the irradiance distribution analysis, it can avoid the influence of the stray light in the specific direction on the normal imaging of the camera in the actual detection process. The imaging quality and aberration of the optical system are analyzed and evaluated by combining the spot diagram, MTF curve and Seidel coefficient, and the results meet the needs of practical application. Then the imaging quality change of the optical system in the range of -110°~60° are analyzed. Finally, the tolerance of the whole system is analyzed.',\n",

Current environmental conditions at the martian surface are harsh and affect the stability of organic molecules. For this reason, and because current and future Mars rovers collect samples from the upper surface layer, it is important to assess the fate of organic molecules under the conditions at the martian surface. Here, we present an experimental study of the evolution of uracil when exposed to UV radiation, pressure, and temperature conditions representative of the surface of Mars. Uracil was selected because it is a nucleobase that composes RNA, and it has been detected in interplanetary bodies that could be the exogenous source of this molecule by meteoritic delivery to the surface of Mars. Our results show that the experimental quantum efficiency of photodecomposition of uracil is 0.16 ± 0.14 molecule/photon. Although these results suggest that uracil is quickly photodegraded when directly exposed to UV light on Mars, such exposure produces dimers that are more stable over time than the monomer. The identified dimers could be targets of interest for current and future Mars space missions.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Stromatolites are ideal ecosystems of microbe-sediment synergy and, therefore, represent a fundamental resource for the recognition of biosignatures and investigation of astrobiological targets with regard to environment and life interactions. Even though they are one of the oldest records of life on Earth, at present, modern occurrences of stromatolites are restricted to extreme environments, such as hypersaline lakes. This work aims to characterize stromatolite features that can be used as biosignatures, seeking to understand their morphogenetic and preservation processes. Samples were collected in Lake Ashenge, a hyperalkaline high-altitude lake located in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia.Two distinct microfacies were observed in the Lake Ashenge stromatolites: a) columnar stromatolites; and b) bulbous stromatolites. Both microfacies feature of slightly laminated microfabric composed of intercalated thicker layers of microsparite and thinner layers of calcite micrite within which exceptionally well-preserved microbial fossils including filamentous and coccoidal cyanobacteria-dominated colonies were recognized. Columnar stromatolite layers show mostly parallel or interlaced vertical arrangements of filamentous microbes which suggest different directions of water flow, demonstrating that the spatial arrangements of microbes reflect the dynamics of the environment. Bulbous structures are composed either of colonies of shrub-like filaments along their entire length and height grading into a vertical parallel arrangement at the top. This type of arrangement suggests self-sustainability of the microbial community, improving the resistance of the structures, in order to endure physical processes in the environment such as currents and wave action or predation. All samples show extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by microbes normally associated with filamentous microbes. In this context, EPS may serve to support and stabilise the biofilm and contribute to the formation of columnar and bulbous structures.Mars 2020 Perseverance rover recorded carbonate occurrences in Martian paleoenvironments from Jezero Crater which have been compared with microbialites and tufas with the potential to preserve biosignatures similar to those found in Lake Ashenge samples. Therefore, although stromatolite morphology itself configures a macroscopic biosignature which may be detected in Mars rover images, the two scales of observation (millimetres- centimetres vs micrometric) identified biosignatures in the stromatolites of Lake Ashenge could also reflect different conditions of the dynamic environment during their development. In this regard, Lake Ashenge illustrates an important modern environment for astrobiological studies and has potential analogy to ancient lacustrine environments on Mars.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Two rover concepts were considered: an unpressurized skeleton vehicle having available 4.5 kW of electrical power and limited to a range of about 10 km from a temporary Martian base and a much larger surface exploration vehicle (SEV) operating on a maximum 75-kW power level and essentially unrestricted in range or mission. The only baseline reference system was a battery-operated skeleton vehicle with very limited mission capability and range and which would repeatedly return to its temporary base for battery recharging. It was quickly concluded that laser powering would be an uneconomical overkill for this concept. The SEV, on the other hand, is a new rover concept that is especially suited for powering by orbiting solar or electrically pumped lasers. Such vehicles are visualized as mobile habitats with full life-support systems onboard, having unlimited range over the Martian surface, and having extensive mission capability (e.g., core drilling and sampling, construction of shelters for protection from solar flares and dust storms, etc.). Laser power beaming to SEV's was shown to have the following advantages: (1) continuous energy supply by three orbiting lasers at 2000 km (no storage requirements as during Martian night with direct solar powering); (2) long-term supply without replacement; (3) very high power available (MW level possible); and (4) greatly enhanced mission enabling capability beyond anything currently conceived.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Although there is no perfect environmental analog to Mars on Earth, quantitative study of relevant terrestrial field sites can serve as the basis for physical models and technology development to aid future exploration. This dissertation describes original field and laboratory research on two terrestrial analog sites: Licancabur Volcano, Bolivia, and the Atacama Desert, Chile. <P />Atop Licancabur, at an elevation of nearly 6,000 meters above sea level, sits the highest volcanic lake on Earth. Prior to this work, little was known about the lake, its waters, the role of volcanism or its potential relationship to locales on Mars. In the first part of this work, I describe observations of the lake resulting from several years of field study, including data on meteorological conditions and solar irradiance. These and other measurements provide the basis for (1) the first quantitative mass and energy balance model of the lake, and (2) the first determination of the altitude effect on solar visible and ultraviolet flux from the high altitude summit. Under the observed conditions, model results indicate: lake waters are primarily meteoric in origin and evaporating rapidly; volcanic input is not required to explain observations of lake water temperature or year-end model results. <P />Nearby, Chile's Atacama Desert is known to be one of the driest, most inhospitable environments on Earth. There, environmental similarities to Mars provide an apt testing ground for new astrobiological exploration technologies. In the latter part of this work, I present results from my work with the Life In The Atacama (LITA) Mars rover field experiment. In particular, I report on the development of a new data analysis tool named the LITA Data Scoring System (DSS). Subject to the user-defined constraints, the DSS was used to facilitate targeting, analysis and mapping of rover science results relevant to potential habitability and evidence for life at three desert field sites. Although experimental in nature, the DSS demonstrated the utility of this type of tool for future astrobiology rovers. <P />The quantitative environmental and operational analogies to Mars are discussed in the conclusion, where they form the basis for recommendations on future avenues of research.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In preparation for a Mars Rover/Sample return mission, the mission goals and objectives must be identified. One of the most important objectives must address exobiology and the question of the possibility of the origin and evolution of life on Mars. In particular, key signatures or bio-markers of a possible extinct Martian biota must be defined. To that end geographic locations (sites) that are likely to contain traces of past life must also be identified. Sites and experiments are being defined in support of a Mars rover sample return mission. In addition, analyses based on computer models of abiotic processes of CO2 loss from Mars suggest that the CO2 from the atmosphere may have precipitated as carbonates and be buried within the Martian regolith. The carbon cycle of perennially frozen lakes in the dry valley of Antarctica are currently being investigated. These lakes were purported to be a model system for the ancient Martian lakes. By understanding the dynamic balance between the abiotic vs. biotic cycling of carbon within this system, information is gathered which will enable the interpretation of data obtained by a Mars rover with respect to possible carbonate deposits and the processing of carbon by biological systems. These ancient carbonate deposits, and other sedimentary units would contain traces of biological signatures that would hold the key to understanding the origin and evolution of life on Mars, as well as Earth.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"One of the Mars 2020 mission's primary science objectives is to seek out traces of past life on Mars - the rover's sample caching system (SCS) will collect and store rock cores and regolith samples for possible return to Earth for analysis by a future mission. These samples must be contaminated with fewer than 10 parts-per-billion (PPB) total organic carbon (TOC) of terrestrial origin to permit an unambiguous detection of Martian organic signatures; this 10 PPB threshold translates to less than a monolayer of adsorbed contaminant molecules on the inside surfaces of sample tubes. Achieving such a stringent requirement has necessitated some of the strictest contamination control protocols ever enacted in NASA's history. Throughout all phases of the mission, sources of terrestrial organic carbon can contaminate samples and sample caching hardware through a variety of transport mechanisms in free-molecular and continuum flow regimes. Predicting and mitigating the contamination of future returned samples requires a comprehensive understanding and cataloging of contaminant sources, transport mechanisms, and adsorption characteristics. Therefore, JPL Contamination Control has developed a novel multispecies model based on experimental measurements of Mars 2020 flight hardware, which has been applied in characterizing organic carbon contaminant sources, species compositions, and outgassing rate dependences on temperature. These are the boundary conditions for an end-to-end modeling framework in which the transport and deposition of contaminant species are calculated for each mission phase, culminating in a prediction of the total quantity of terrestrial organic carbon within future returned samples.\",\n",

This study investigated the rock abundance and erosion rate at the landing site of the Chinese Mars rover, Zhurong, in southern Utopia Planitia. A convolutional neural network based method was developed for rock detection from the images (0.7 m/pixel) obtained by using the high-resolution imaging camera (HiRIC) onboard the Tianwen-1 orbiter. Approximately 10,000 rocks with a minimum diameter of 1.4 m (2 pixels on the image) were extracted from the HiRIC images covering the Zhurong landing site and its neighboring region. According to the results, the rock abundance at the Zhurong landing site was approximately 5%. Measurements from the ground images acquired by the Zhurong rover after landing confirmed a rock abundance of approximately 5% at the landing site, consistent with the orbital measurement before landing. Furthermore, we investigated the rock erosion rate at the Zhurong landing region. Rock abundance was negatively correlated with the crater retention age and positively correlated with crater diameter. The obtained rock breakdown rate (0.054 nm/y to 0.074 nm/y) and surface denudation rate by filled volume of craters (0.104 nm/y to 0.209 nm/y) were in agreement with the values previously reported for the Amazonian period on Mars.

       "    'abstract': 'This dissertation describes research involving vision techniques which would be useful in an autonomous exploring vehicle, such as a Mars rover. These techniques produce a description of the surroundings of the vehicle in terms of the position, size, and approximate shape of objects, and can match such scene descriptions with others previously produced. The information produced is thus useful both for navigation and obstacle avoidance. The techniques operate by using three dimensional data which they can produce by means of stereo vision from stereo picture pairs or which can be obtained from a laser rangefinder. The research thus divides conveniently into two portions: stereo mapping and three dimensional modelling and matching. The stereo mapping techniques are designed to be suitable for the kind of pictures that a Mars rover might obtain and to produce the kind of data that the modelling techniques need. These stereo techniques are based upon area correlation and produce a depth map of the scene. Emphasis is placed upon extraction of useful data from noisy pictures and upon the estimation of the accuracy of the data produced. Included are the following: a self-calibration method for computing the stereo camera model (the relative position and orientation of the two camera positions); a high-resolution stereo correlator for producing accurate matches with accuracy and confidence estimates, which includes the ability to compensate for brightness and contrast changes between the pictures; a search technique for using the correlator to produce a dense sampling of matched points for a pair of pictures; and the computation of the distances to the matched points, including the propagation of the accuracy estimates.',\n",

This simulator was used to perform a parametric study at the Johnson Space Center of various low L/D vehicles and their performance with the inclusion of vehicle and atmospheric dispersions. The ultimate goal is to define an extreme (minimum L/D) aeroassist configuration for the Mars Rover/Sample Return Mission to compare with the previously defined biconic aeroshell. The study shows that a raked cone vehicle with L/D betweeen 0.3 and 0.6 will perform adequately in the Martian environment in the presence of dispersions. Average apoapsis error for the 0.6 L/D vehicle was 11.9 km (6.4 nm) above the 2000 km target which compares fairly well with an error of 3.5 km (1.9 nm) for the 1.5 L/D biconic vehicle. The study concluded that the low L/D raked configuration warrants further study which could include stability analysis as well as the inclusion of density shears and dynamic atmospheric variations.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In this study, LED based mini-lidar to install into Mars rover has been developed. Its aim is to capture the dynamics of dust twister called \"Dust Devil\". For Mars rover installation, there are large restrictions of 10cm3 optics size, 1kg weight, 1W power consumption, etc. We have developed its concept model, and conducted the demonstration experiment. The LED mini-lidar is equipped with a high speed photon counter, of which data sampling interval is 1ns, corresponding to a range bin of 0.15m, and a high repetition pulsed LED beam, of which repetition frequency is greater than 500kHz. Transmitting optical pulse power was &lt;10nJ/10ns (= 1W). For summation time of greater than 0.2s, surface atmosphere activity in the order of seconds can be visualized with this high resolution. The dynamics measurement of an artificial twister was successfully conducted with this mini-lidar. In this report, the quantitative measurement method to distinguish dust samples in relation to Zirconia beads measurements is proposed. The relationship between the shaking off dust weight and its scattering cross section is obtained. The dust chamber experiment was conducted with several kinds of dust particles, too. These lidar echo results were compared with transmissometer, and they were well coincided due to the concentration change. The nature fog observation was conducted with this mini-lidar, too. The liquid water content was estimated under the consideration of the result of the quantitative measurement.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Sulfate salt discoveries at the Eagle and Endurance craters in Meridiani Planum by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity have proven mineralogically the existence and involvement of water in Mars' past. Visible and near infrared spectrometers like the Mars Express OMEGA, the upcoming 2006 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM and the 2009 Mars Science Laboratory Rover cameras may facilitate the identification of water-bearing salts. Increasing spectral resolution and rover mission lifetimes currently necessitate greater data compression in order to ease downlink restrictions. On board data processing techniques such as automated mineral identification can ease bandwidth stress and increase scientific return. We have developed an automated support vector machine (SVM) detector operating in the VisNIR (300-2500 nm) spectral range trained to recognize the mineral jarosite (KFe<SUB>3</SUB>(SO<SUB>4</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB>(OH)<SUB>6</SUB>). The detector input includes spectral wavelength intervals covering the primary jarositic spectral features at 620, 900 and 2280 nm and avoiding noisy features caused by atmospheric water vapor at 1400 and 1900 nm. The detector is trained on spectral library data (USGS speclib04) of 4 jarosite varieties and 85 samples of 21 non-jarosite minerals appropriate to Mars. To improve the training set, pure spectra were augmented with binary, tertiary and quaternary linear mixtures of spectra of the two (jarosite and non-jarosite) mineral groups. SVMs map training data into a high-dimensional kernel space and then fit a hyperplane that best separates the two classes of data. Initial results using spectra of pure (museum-quality) mineral samples taken in the laboratory include the correct identification of 16 jarosite spectra out of 209 diverse total spectra with no false negatives and one false positive. Results from laboratory spectra collected from field samples with mixed sulfate and phyllosilicate mineralogies include the correct detection of one jarosite and correct rejection of 13 clearly non-jarositic samples. Three of eight remaining samples were also detected as jarosite though the accuracy of these results will not be clear until the samples can be analyzed chemically. Future work will include the creation of detectors for other sulfate salts such as alunite (KAl<SUB>3</SUB>(SO<SUB>4</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB>(OH)<SUB>6</SUB>) and other related minerals.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"In the past year, the conceptual design of a panoramic imager for the Mars Environmental Survey (MESUR) Pathfinder was finished. A prototype camera was built and its performace in the laboratory was tested. The performance of this camera was excellent. Based on this work, we have recently proposed a small, lightweight, rugged, and highly capable Mars Surface Imager (MSI) instrument for the MESUR Pathfinder mission. A key aspect of our approach to optimization of the MSI design is that we treat image gathering, coding, and restoration as a whole, rather than as separate and independent tasks. Our approach leads to higher image quality, especially in the representation of fine detail with good contrast and clarity, without increasing either the complexity of the camera or the amount of data transmission. We have made significant progress over the past year in both the overall MSI system design and in the detailed design of the MSI optics. We have taken a simple panoramic camera and have upgraded it substantially to become a prototype of the MSI flight instrument. The most recent version of the camera utilizes miniature wide-angle optics that image directly onto a 3-color, 2096-element CCD line array. There are several data-taking modes, providing resolution as high as 0.3 mrad/pixel. Analysis tasks that were performed or that are underway with the test data from the prototype camera include the following: construction of 3-D models of imaged scenes from stereo data, first for controlled scenes and later for field scenes; and checks on geometric fidelity, including alignment errors, mast vibration, and oscillation in the drive system. We have outlined a number of tasks planned for Fiscal Year '93 in order to prepare us for submission of a flight instrument proposal for MESUR Pathfinder.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Mars dust storms are an interdisciplinary field of research. They have adverse effects for the entry-descent-landing operations of spacecraft, the energy production by the solar panels of Mars rovers and landers, and others. A dramatic example is the loss of the Mars rover Opportunity during a global dust storm event in 2018. As can be foreseen, dust storms also have implications for future human exploration of Mars. Dust storm research is directly aligned with the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) science objective on the lower atmosphere, and also to the objective of correlating the lower and upper atmosphere [1]. This presentation outlines dust storm research related to EMM. Owing to its high altitude orbit, its instrumentation will provide snapshots of the Mars atmosphere and surface at a near-hemispheric view. Moreover, EMM will provide situational information on Mars dust storms each few hours. EMM entered Mars orbit on Feb. 9th, 2021 (Ls ~0). The EMM Science Phase officially commenced on May 23rd, 2021 (Ls ~49). As follows, the early EMM Science Phase coincides with the Low Dust Loading Season (LS ~0-140), known for the sparsity of dust storms at low-to-mid latitudes. We will use initial EMM data products for feasibility demonstration. If available, this shall include early stage EMM dust storm observations. In support of this, we also give an update on dust storm model simulations and follow-on work. These simulations are based on running the MarsWRF model, using the interactive-dust-technique. This means that the model produces dust storms in a fully self-consistent manner, i.e. independent of any external data on the dust cycle. Recent work has been documented in [2,3].

       "    'abstract': \"In order to achieve high precision of initial alignment and inertial sensor calibration, this paper proposes a high accuracy multiplex two-position alignment method based on SINS (Strapdown Inertial Navigation System) with the aid of star sensor. Firstly, the Mars rover's approximate initial position is determined by the lander's landing position, and its initial attitude is obtained with the time and the output of star sensor. Based on that, a two-position alignment method aided by star sensor's precise attitude information is used to improve accuracy of initial alignment and inertial sensor calibration. It can take full advantages of both inertial navigation and celestial navigation. Finally, we deduce the relationships between estimation errors of accelerometer bias, estimation errors of misalignment angles and position errors. The rover's higher accuracy initial alignment is achieved by using the deduced relationships and the estimates of accelerometer bias to correct the rover's initial position and attitude. The simulation results demonstrate that the presented method can meet the high accuracy requirements of the rover's initial alignment and inertial sensor calibration.\",\n",

The MVP-SEM is under development to eventually provide this instrument for the surface of Mars. This development is funded by the NASA Planetary Instrument Concepts for the Advancement of Solar System Observations (PICASSO) Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) and is based on previous miniaturized SEM designs and advancements in the miniaturization of vacuum systems and detectors for low vacuum sample chambers. The variable pressure aspect of the SEM allows for unprepared (uncoated) samples to be analyzed by utilizing the carbon dioxide-rich Mars atmosphere for the neutralization of sample charging from the electron beam. This property of the MVP-SEM makes it ideal for use in locations where complex sample preparation is not desirable, such as the surface of Mars. In addition, the lack of sample preparation needed here simplifies the sample acquisition process and allows caching of the samples for future complementary payload use or eventual delivery to Earth.The MVP-SEM team is comprised of an Instrument Development Team and a Science Team. The Instrument Development Team is led by NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and its members include the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Applied Physics Technologies, and Creare LLC. The MVP-SEM Science Team members include planetary scientists, astrobiologists, members of ongoing Mars rover mission science teams, and research engineers.Science requirements for the instrument include: 1) an imaging system capable of resolving uncoated objects or phases 100nm in size or better, 2) determination of the geochemistry of uncoated samples to a precision of 2 weight percent per major element, 3) capability to analyze materials with little to no sample preparation, 4) the ability to analyze multiple samples with a reusable sample holder, 5) production of images capable of being downlinked to Earth, and 6) ability to operate on a Mars-landed spacecraft.The Instrument Development Team constrained the operational conditions of the instrument for imaging by testing with terrestrial SEMs using carbon dioxide gas for the appropriate electron scattering and charge neutralization conditions.

The rovers are all-terrain exploration platforms, carrying third-party payloads: scientific instrumentation. \"Wisdom\" ground penetrating radar for Exomars mission has been tested onboard, as well as electrical resistivity module and other devices. Robot has operated in various environments, such as Central European countryside, Dachstein ice caves or Sahara, Morocco (controlled remotely via satellite from Toruń, Poland. Currently ABM SE works on local and global positioning system for a Mars rover basing on image and IMU data. This is performed under a project from ESA. In the next Mars rover missions a Mars GIS model will be build, including an acquired GPR profile, DEM and regular image data, integrated into a concurrent 3D terrain model. It is proposed to use similar approach in surveys of archaeological sites, especially those, where solid architecture remains can be expected at shallow depths or being partially exposed. It is possible to deploy a rover that will concurrently map a selected site with GPR, 2D and 3D cameras to create a site model. The rover image processing algorithms are capable of automatic tracing of distinctive features (such as exposed structure remains on a desert ground, differences in color of the ground, etc.) and to mark regularities on a created map. It is also possible to correlate the 3D map with an aerial photo taken under any angle to achieve interpretation synergy. Currently the algorithms are an interpretation aid and their results must be confirmed by a human. The advantages of a rover over traditional approaches, such as a manual cart or a drone include: a) long hours of continuous work or work in unfavorable environment, such as high desert, frozen water pools or large areas, b) concurrent multisensory data acquisition, c) working from the ground level enables capturing of sites obstructed from the air (trees), d) it is possible to control the platform from a remote location via satellite, with only servicing person on the site and the survey team operating from their office, globally.

       "    'abstract': 'The Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) will investigate environmental factors directly tied to current habitability at the Martian surface during the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. Three major habitability factors are addressed by REMS: the thermal environment, ultraviolet irradiation, and water cycling. The thermal environment is determined by a mixture of processes, chief amongst these being the meteorological. Accordingly, the REMS sensors have been designed to record air and ground temperatures, pressure, relative humidity, wind speed in the horizontal and vertical directions, as well as ultraviolet radiation in different bands. These sensors are distributed over the rover in four places: two booms located on the MSL Remote Sensing Mast, the ultraviolet sensor on the rover deck, and the pressure sensor inside the rover body. Typical daily REMS observations will collect 180 minutes of data from all sensors simultaneously (arranged in 5 minute hourly samples plus 60 additional minutes taken at times to be decided during the course of the mission). REMS will add significantly to the environmental record collected by prior missions through the range of simultaneous observations including water vapor; the ability to take measurements routinely through the night; the intended minimum of one Martian year of observations; and the first measurement of surface UV irradiation. In this paper, we describe the scientific potential of REMS measurements and describe in detail the sensors that constitute REMS and the calibration procedures.',\n",

Given analytical formulation to predict mobility performance in extraterrestrial environments requires reliable in situ testing campaigns, this imposes fundamental restrictions to conceive a more consolidated theory, and further any possibility to use improved empirical methods to design better space hardware. Hence, we propose an analytical approach to extrapolate data taken in parabolic flights to model vehicle performance in multiple gravity regimes. The extrapolation technique and respective reported uncertainties can be used, therefore, to tune fitting parameters of a set of general formulas in the domain of Terramechanics, allowing to have empirical estimates of the wheel mobility in cases where testing is inherently very complex. Finally, by the analysis of previous Moon and Mars rover missions with the fitted equations, we report an empirical design criterion that allows to generate first estimates of the optimal wheel dimensions, taking into account the eventual longitudinal slip of the rover and including the desired mass of the payload. The introduced rules for geometry optimization can be important for future space rover missions in remote soils.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In order to select the most efficient kind of a martian exploring vehicle, the similarity criteria are deduced from the equilibrium movement in the terrestrial and martian conditions. Different invariants have been obtained for the existing (entry capsules, parachutes and rovers) and potential martian exploring vehicles (lighter-than-air vehicle, airplane, helicopter and Mars Jumper). These similarity criteria, as non-dimensional numbers, allow to quickly compare if such kind of vehicles can operate in the martian environment, the movement performances, the necessary geometrical dimensions and the power consumption. Following this way of study it was concluded what vehicle is most suitable for the near soil Mars exploration. “Mars Rover” has less power consumption on Mars, but due to the rugged terrain the performances are weak. A vacuumed rigid airship is possible to fly with high performances and endurance on Mars, versus the impossibility of such a machine on the Earth. Due to very low density and the low Reynolds numbers in the Mars atmosphere, the power consumption for the martian airplane or helicopter is substantially higher. The most efficient vehicle for the Mars exploration seems to be a machine using the in situ non-chemical propellants: the 95% CO<SUB>2</SUB> atmosphere and the weak solar radiation. A small compressor, electrically driven by photovoltaics, compresses the gas in a storage tank, in time. If the gas is expanded through a nozzle, sufficient lift and control forces are obtained for a VTOL flight of kilometers over the martian soil, in comparison with tens of meters of the actual Mars rovers.',\n",

All three contractors based their designs on the Technology Demonstration Convertor (TDC) developed by Stirling Technology Company (STC) for DOE. The contract award to a single system integration contractor for Phases II and III of the SRG program is anticipated in late 2001. The first potential SRG mission is targeted for a Mars rover. This paper provides a description of the Flight Prototype (FP) Stirling convertor design as compared to the previous TDC design.

       "    'abstract': 'Autonomy for robots interacting with sand will enable a wide range of beneficial behaviors, from earth moving for construction and farming vehicles to navigating rough terrain for Mars rovers. The goal of this work is to shape sand into desired forms. Unlike other common autonomous tasks of achieving desired state of a robot, achieving a desired shape of a continuously deformable environment like sand is a much more challenging task. The state of robot can be described with a couple of states-x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw-but the desired shape of sand can not be described with just a few values. Sand is an aggregation of billions of small particles. After simplifying the model of sand and tool interaction by looking only at the surface of the heightmap, we can formulate the problems into something that is still high dimensional (hundreds to thousands of state dimensions) but much more solvable. We show how this problem can be formulated into a graph search problem and solve it with the A-star algorithm and report preliminary results on using deep reinforcement learning methods like Deep Q-Network and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"In Gale crater on Mars, the rover Curiosity has discovered evidence of fluid mobilization of the redox-sensitive element manganese. We present results for Mn from Curiosity's Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), which show that the average MnO concentration in mudstone-dominated sedimentary units (0.22 wt%) is about one-half of the concentration in the average Mars crust (0.44 wt%). Geochemical trends indicate that Mn in the sedimentary bedrock, most of which has a basaltic provenance, was leached by chemical alteration and dissolution. In &gt;350 vertical meters of mudstone-dominated strata, the apparent leaching of Mn and retention of Fe in Fe-O-H phase(s) resulted in the fractionation of Fe and Mn, indicating relatively moderate Eh-pH fluid conditions that were not highly alkaline, reducing, or oxidizing. Exceptions are fracture-associated, silica-rich haloes where both Mn and Fe were leached by low pH fluids. The rover also discovered Mn-rich veins, nodules, and patchy, dark coatings on rock surfaces, which are variably associated with enrichments in Fe, P, Cl, and/or Zn. These Mn-rich features represent ∼1% of the 1029 APXS measurements acquired over ∼25 km of rover traverse. A thermochemical model shows that dissolved Mn<SUP>2+</SUP> could have been concentrated via evaporation, sublimation, and/or freezing. Manganese was then likely precipitated in localized features when &gt;99.99% of the Mn<SUP>2+</SUP>-bearing water was removed from the system. These findings indicate that Mn was mobile in Gale crater and therefore bioavailable as a potential energy source for life.\",\n",

Chemical evolution could have occurred there, maybe advanced enough to be currently just a few steps away of forming autoreplicative and evolvable systems, i.e., biological entities. So far, the instruments used in planetary exploration to investigate organics have been focused on detecting heat-extracted, small volatile compounds, due to sample preparation constraints; however, these are inefficient procedures and very often the taphonomy of the parent (bio)molecules is lost. It is critical to provide innovative and advanced analytical instrumentation that allow the detection of large macromolecular material capable of structural and functional plasticity as well as cell-like morphologies. This might clarify what is the level of (bio)chemical complexity in the Solar System, both now and in the past. <P />Here we describe a new concept approach consisting of a suite of first-order, in situ analytical instruments and sensors essential to determining different levels of prebiotic/biotic chemical and structural complexities in planets and satellites of the Solar System. We propose that the critical instruments to perform such a comprehensive astrobiological reconnaissance would be: (1) a microscope to resolve microscale evidences for life; (2) a Raman spectrometer to detect signatures of organic (bio)molecules of different sizes and complexities, even different from those operating in terrestrial biochemistry; and (3) a biomarker detector equipped with a biosensor containing multiple bioaffinity probes (including antibodies and aptamers) for relevant biochemical compounds. We particularly highlight the contributions made by Centro de Astrobiología in Spain to get this type of instruments flight-ready for upcoming missions to Mars: the Raman included in the science payload of the ESA's 2020 Rosalind Franklin Mars rover (RLS instrument), and the biomarker detector included as payload in the NASA's IceBreaker lander mission proposal (SOLID instrument). Our concept is a robust solution that builds on the combination of three complementary existing techniques to cover a wide spectrum of targets in the search for (bio)chemical complexity in the Solar System.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Crack networks are ubiquitous on planetary surfaces, across a vast range of scales and materials. From Earth\\'s tectonic plates, to the shattered icy crusts of Europa and Pluto, to putative mudcracks observed by the Mars rover Curiosity; all arise when thin sheets of sufficiently brittle material are stressed to the breaking point. It was recently discovered that fracture networks may be well characterized as convex mosaics; this means that their topology is completely described by counting the numbers of vertices ($v$) and nodes ($n$) (see Domokos et al., 2020). Moreover, experiments and simulations indicate that the topology of fracture networks is determined by the formative stress field, potentially allowing us to extract information about the mechanism of crack formation from images of planetary surfaces. The average topology of these networks may be analytically related to more traditional properties of crack networks such as junction angle, but has the advantage that it is insensitive to issues of scale or image angle. This makes network topology an attractive technique for application to planetary surface images. Here we examine two-dimensional (2D) fracture mosaics on the surfaces of planets and moons across our solar system. Using the framework of convex mosaics to count cracking patterns, we catalog these mosaics in terms of their average values $\\\\bar{n}$ and $\\\\bar{v}$ (plotted in Fig. 1). Similar to Earth\\'s fracture mosaics, these planetary mosaics are bracketed by rectangular and hexagonal polygonal patterns (on average). On Earth, the former are most common and arise under generic (deviatoric) stress conditions, while the latter form under specific directional stresses. Our measurements are able to discriminate between primary and secondary fracture patterns. We also identify patterns that are not well represented by polygons; they contain curvy edges that appear to be associated with \"twisting\\'\\' of junction angles, as happens for mudcracks after repeated wetting and drying. Using our measurements, we address previously proposed mechanisms for the formation of: polygonal terrain on Pluto; mobile lithospheric blocks on Venus; apparent mudcracks on Mars; and diverse chaos terrains. We are always looking for new potential fracture mosaics to analyze, so will be seeking input from the audience.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Automatic detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples or features is universally needed when working with scientific datasets. This capability can be used for cleaning datasets, e.g., flagging ground-truth labels with GPS or human entry error or identifying wrongly categorized objects in a catalog. It could also be used for discovery, e.g., to flag novel samples in order to guide instrument acquisition or scientific analysis. We are developing Domain-agnostic Outlier Ranking Algorithms (DORA) to provide a configurable pipeline that makes it easy for scientists to apply and evaluate outlier detection methods in a variety of domains. DORA allows users to configure outlier detection experiments by specifying the location of their dataset(s), the input data type, feature extraction methods, and which algorithms should be applied. DORA will support image, raster, time series, or feature vector input data types and outlier detection methods that include Isolation Forest, Discovery via Eigenbasis Modeling of Uninteresting Data (DEMUD), principal component analysis (PCA), Reed-Xiaoli (RX) detector, Local RX, negative sampling, and probabilistic autoencoder. Given a set of data samples, each algorithm assigns an outlier score to each sample. DORA provides results organization and visualization modules to help users process the results, including sorting samples by outlier score, evaluating outlier recall for a set of known/labeled outliers, clustering groups of similar outliers together, and causal graphs. To demonstrate the cross-divisional applicability of DORA, we are conducting outlier detection experiments for four use cases: 1) cleaning noisy ground-truth datasets (Earth Science), 2) detecting volcanic thermal anomalies (Earth Science), 3) flagging non-astrophysical objects in the Dark Energy Survey (astrophysics), and 4) novelty-guided onboard targeting of instruments for Mars rovers (planetary science). DORA will be made openly available as a pip-installable python package for use by the broader scientific community.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Life in the Atacama project examined six different sites in the Atacama Desert (Chile) over 3 years in an attempt to remotely detect the presence of life with a rover. The remote science team, using only orbital and rover data sets, identified areas with a high potential for life as targets for further inspection by the rover. Orbital data in the visible/near infrared (VNIR) and in the thermal infrared (TIR) were used to examine the mineralogy, geomorphology, and chlorophyll potential of the field sites. Field instruments included two spectrometers (VNIR reflectance and TIR emission) and a neutron detector: this project represents the first time a neutron detector has been used as part of a ``science-blind'' rover field test. Rover-based spectroscopy was used to identify the composition of small scale features not visible in the orbital images and to improve interpretations of those data sets. The orbital and ground-based data sets produced consistent results, suggesting that much of the field sites consist of altered volcanic terrains with later deposits of sulfates, quartz, and iron oxides. At one location (Site A), the ground-based spectral data revealed considerably greater compositional diversity than was seen from the orbital view. One neutron detector transect provided insight into subsurface hydrogen concentrations, which correlated with life and surface features. The results presented here have implications for targeting strategies, especially for future Mars rover missions looking for potential habitats/paleohabitats.\",\n",

The main specificity of this database is to include a significant fraction of spectra of unprocessed rock, which are more realistic analogs and often have different spectral features than the fine powders more commonly analyzed in reflectance spectroscopy. Additionally, these measurements were acquired with a spectrometer whose spot size is similar to those of the SuperCam instrument (Mars 2020 mission) at a few meters from a target. Supplementary information are provided in the ROMA database: higher-level data (such as absorption band parameters) as well as sample mineralogy estimated by whole-rock X-ray diffraction analyses. Future comparisons with this database will help improve the interpretation of spectral measurements acquired on the Martian surface.

       "    'abstract': 'Upcoming Mars Surveyor lander missions will include extensive spectroscopic capabilities designed to improve interpretations of the mineralogy and geology of landing sites on Mars. The 1999 Marsokhod Field Experiment (MFE) was a Mars rover simulation designed in part to investigate the utility of visible/near-infrared and thermal infrared field spectrometers to contribute to the remote geological exploration of a Mars analog field site in the California Mojave Desert. The experiment simultaneously investigated the abilities of an off-site science team to effectively analyze and acquire useful imaging and spectroscopic data and to communicate efficiently with rover engineers and an on-site field team to provide meaningful input to rover operations and traverse planning. Experiences gained during the MFE regarding effective communication between different mission operation teams will be useful to upcoming Mars mission teams. Field spectra acquired during the MFE mission exhibited features interpreted at the time as indicative of carbonates (both dolomitic and calcitic), mafic rocks and associated weathering products, and silicic rocks with desert varnish-like coatings. The visible/near-infrared spectra also suggested the presence of organic compounds, including chlorophyll in one rock. Postmission laboratory petrologic and spectral analyses of returned samples confirmed that all rocks identified as carbonates using field measurements alone were calc-silicates and that chlorophyll associated with endolithic organisms was present in the one rock for which it was predicted. Rocks classified from field spectra as silicics and weathered mafics were recognized in the laboratory as metamorphosed monzonites and diorite schists. This discrepancy was likely due to rock coatings sampled by the field spectrometers compared to fresh rock interiors analyzed petrographically, in addition to somewhat different surfaces analyzed by laboratory thermal spectroscopy compared to field spectra.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Raman spectrometers will be utilized on two Mars rover missions, ExoMars and Mars 2020, in the near future, to search for evidence of life and habitable geological niches on Mars. Carotenoid pigments are recognized target biomarkers, and as they are highly active in Raman spectroscopy, they can be readily used to characterize the capabilities of space representative instrumentation. As part of the preparatory work being performed for the ExoMars mission, a gypsum crust colonized by microorganisms was interrogated with commercial portable Raman instruments and a flight representative Raman laser spectrometer. Four separate layers, each exhibiting different coloration resulting from specific halophilic microorganism activities within the gypsum crust, were studied by using two excitation wavelengths: 532 and 785 nm. Raman or fluorescence data were readily obtained during the present study. Gypsum, the main constituent of the crust, was detected with both excitation wavelengths, while the resonance Raman signal associated with carotenoid pigments was only detected with a 532 nm excitation wavelength. The fluorescence originating from bacteriochlorophyll a was found to overwhelm the Raman signal for the layer colonized by sulfur bacteria when interrogated with a 785 nm excitation wavelength. Finally, it was demonstrated that portable instruments and the prototype were capable of detecting a statistically significant difference in band positions of carotenoid signals between the sample layers.',\n",

Overall, ChemCam supports MSL with five capabilities: remote classification of rock and soil characteristics; quantitative elemental compositions including light elements like hydrogen and some elements to which LIBS is uniquely sensitive (e.g., Li, Be, Rb, Sr, Ba); remote removal of surface dust and depth profiling through surface coatings; context imaging; and passive spectroscopy over the 240-905 nm range. ChemCam is built in two sections: The mast unit, consisting of a laser, telescope, RMI, and associated electronics, resides on the rover's mast, and is described in a companion paper. ChemCam's body unit, which is mounted in the body of the rover, comprises an optical demultiplexer, three spectrometers, detectors, their coolers, and associated electronics and data handling logic. Additional instrument components include a 6 m optical fiber which transfers the LIBS light from the telescope to the body unit, and a set of onboard calibration targets. ChemCam was integrated and tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory where it also underwent LIBS calibration with 69 geological standards prior to integration with the rover. Post-integration testing used coordinated mast and instrument commands, including LIBS line scans on rock targets during system-level thermal-vacuum tests. In this paper we describe the body unit, optical fiber, and calibration targets, and the assembly, testing, and verification of the instrument prior to launch.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"A novel deployable radiator system has been designed to reject kilowatt-scale power at a fraction of the mass compared to existing technology. The architecture involves a mechanically pumped fluid loop (MPFL) system, inspired by Mars Rover missions, to scale up for the high heat-rejection capabilities that will be necessary as spacecraft become more powerful. The system consists of layered and tapered radiator panels that undergo a similar deployment to rigid solar panels: stowed in a zigzag configuration before flattening straight out. Thin tubes are proposed as structural connectors between panels, acting as deployable hinges as well as thermal-fluid transport tubes. Experiments have characterized the tubes' bending moment vs angle relationship, and a prototype successfully demonstrated the deployment process using only static pressure from an accumulator which would be sufficient to deploy the tubes in space. A release mechanism for initiating the deployment, using a scrolling sheet released through a burn wire, enables deployment after experiencing launching loads. The single-phase fluid loop system was designed based on existing similar technology, and simplified in order to reduce mass and complexity. The performance of traditional radiator panels is improved by combining advances in materials science with optimal thermal geometry. Instead of aluminum sandwich panels, pyrolytic graphite sheets are used in a tapered configuration to reject 61 W for each 126 g panel when at the layer base temperature of 300K. Finite element analysis and numerical models are used to determine the effects of layer anisotropy of the design, as well as compute the thermal performance. A single radiator panel was prototyped with the same process and materials as proposed, and the design appears capable of good thermal contact without the need for fasteners. A dynamic analysis was conducted for the 28-panel system for the expected critical modes of vibration resulting in an insufficient natural frequency of 0.02 Hz. Through the addition of lightweight hinges and lengthened panels, the system is expected to perform with a fundamental frequency over 0.4 Hz, which is similar to existing deployed panel arrays. Finally, a thermal resistance network was created and solved numerically to determine the heat rejection from a 28-panel pumped-fluid-loop system for a 50° C spacecraft. Areal density was found to be 1.9 kg/m2 , or 3.9 kg/m2 if considering planform area, both considering the total system mass. Heat flux, or rejection per unit radiating area is 205 W/m2 , or 409 W/m2 for the planform area. With a weight of 13.3 kg, the system is projected to reject 1400 W of heat, 106 W/kg, a threefold improvement in specific power over similar existing architectures. By incorporating features, developing, and scaling aspects of this design, the next generation of high-power space missions can be realized.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Scheduled to land in August of 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Mission was initiated to explore the habitability of Mars. This includes both modern environments as well as ancient environments recorded by the stratigraphic rock record preserved at the Gale crater landing site. The Curiosity rover has a designed lifetime of at least one Mars year (∼23 months), and drive capability of at least 20 km. Curiosity's science payload was specifically assembled to assess habitability and includes a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer and gas analyzer that will search for organic carbon in rocks, regolith fines, and the atmosphere (SAM instrument); an x-ray diffractometer that will determine mineralogical diversity (CheMin instrument); focusable cameras that can image landscapes and rock/regolith textures in natural color (MAHLI, MARDI, and Mastcam instruments); an alpha-particle x-ray spectrometer for in situ determination of rock and soil chemistry (APXS instrument); a laser-induced breakdown spectrometer to remotely sense the chemical composition of rocks and minerals (ChemCam instrument); an active neutron spectrometer designed to search for water in rocks/regolith (DAN instrument); a weather station to measure modern-day environmental variables (REMS instrument); and a sensor designed for continuous monitoring of background solar and cosmic radiation (RAD instrument). The various payload elements will work together to detect and study potential sampling targets with remote and in situ measurements; to acquire samples of rock, soil, and atmosphere and analyze them in onboard analytical instruments; and to observe the environment around the rover. The 155-km diameter Gale crater was chosen as Curiosity's field site based on several attributes: an interior mountain of ancient flat-lying strata extending almost 5 km above the elevation of the landing site; the lower few hundred meters of the mountain show a progression with relative age from clay-bearing to sulfate-bearing strata, separated by an unconformity from overlying likely anhydrous strata; the landing ellipse is characterized by a mixture of alluvial fan and high thermal inertia/high albedo stratified deposits; and a number of stratigraphically/geomorphically distinct fluvial features. Samples of the crater wall and rim rock, and more recent to currently active surface materials also may be studied. Gale has a well-defined regional context and strong evidence for a progression through multiple potentially habitable environments. These environments are represented by a stratigraphic record of extraordinary extent, and insure preservation of a rich record of the environmental history of early Mars. The interior mountain of Gale Crater has been informally designated at Mount Sharp, in honor of the pioneering planetary scientist Robert Sharp. The major subsystems of the MSL Project consist of a single rover (with science payload), a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, an Earth-Mars cruise stage, an entry, descent, and landing system, a launch vehicle, and the mission operations and ground data systems. The primary communication path for downlink is relay through the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The primary path for uplink to the rover is Direct-from-Earth. The secondary paths for downlink are Direct-to-Earth and relay through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. Curiosity is a scaled version of the 6-wheel drive, 4-wheel steering, rocker bogie system from the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) Spirit and Opportunity and the Mars Pathfinder Sojourner. Like Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity offers three primary modes of navigation: blind-drive, visual odometry, and visual odometry with hazard avoidance. Creation of terrain maps based on HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) and other remote sensing data were used to conduct simulated driving with Curiosity in these various modes, and allowed selection of the Gale crater landing site which requires climbing the base of a mountain to achieve its primary science goals. The Sample Acquisition, Processing, and Handling (SA/SPaH) subsystem is responsible for the acquisition of rock and soil samples from the Martian surface and the processing of these samples into fine particles that are then distributed to the analytical science instruments. The SA/SPaH subsystem is also responsible for the placement of the two contact instruments (APXS, MAHLI) on rock and soil targets. SA/SPaH consists of a robotic arm and turret-mounted devices on the end of the arm, which include a drill, brush, soil scoop, sample processing device, and the mechanical and electrical interfaces to the two contact science instruments. SA/SPaH also includes drill bit boxes, the organic check material, and an observation tray, which are all mounted on the front of the rover, and inlet cover mechanisms that are placed over the SAM and CheMin solid sample inlet tubes on the rover top deck.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"To explore high priority landing sites and to prepare for eventual human exploration, future Mars missions will involve rovers capable of traversing tens of kilometers. However, the current process by which scientists interact with a rover does not scale to such distances. Specifically, numerous command cycles are required to complete even simple tasks, such as, pointing the spectrometer at a variety of nearby rocks. In addition, the time required by scientists to interpret image data before new commands can be given and the limited amount of data that can be downlinked during a given command cycle constrains rover mobility and achievement of science goals. Experience with rover tests on Earth supports these concerns. As a result, traverses to science sites as identified in orbital images would require numerous science command cycles over a period of many weeks, months or even years, perhaps exceeding rover design life and other constraints. Autonomous onboard science analysis can address these problems in two ways. First, it will allow the rover to transmit only ``interesting'' images, defined as those likely to have higher science content. Second, the rover will be able to anticipate future commands. For example, a rover might autonomously acquire and return spectra of ``interesting'' rocks along with a high-resolution image of those rocks in addition to returning the context images in which they were detected. Such approaches, coupled with appropriate navigational software, help to address both the data volume and command cycle bottlenecks that limit both rover mobility and science yield. We are developing fast, autonomous algorithms to enable such intelligent on-board decision making by spacecraft. Autonomous algorithms developed to date have the ability to identify rocks and layers in a scene, locate the horizon, and compress multi-spectral image data. Output from these algorithms could be used to autonomously obtain rock spectra, determine which images should be transmitted to the ground, or to aid in image compression. We will discuss these and other algorithms and demonstrate their performance during a recent rover field test.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Forbush decreases (FDs) can be used as one of the \"signatures\" of an ICME passage. An analytical diffusion-expansion FD model (ForbMod) was developed that is based on the widely used approach of an initially empty, closed magnetic structure (i.e. flux rope) that fills up slowly with particles by diffusion perpendicular to the magnetic field of the flux rope. In our approach the FD amplitude is not only determined by the diffusion process but also by the expansion of the flux rope. While the first process leads to a smaller amplitude the second one leads again to a larger effect. Remote CME observations and 3D reconstruction is used to constrain initial and boundary conditions. CME evolutionary properties are taken into account by incorporating the flux rope expansion. Several options of flux rope expansion are regarded as competing mechanism to diffusion, which can lead to different FD characteristics, and forward modelling is used to analyse flux rope expansion and further constrain the model. In testing the model, a number of spacecraft and planetary observation is utilised, including those by the Radiation Assessment Detector aboard the Mars Rover Curiosity.

       "    'abstract': 'Bedrock outcrops were analyzed inside craters on Mars at Meridiani Planum with correlating HiRISE based remote and the Opportunity rover based in-situ images. The aim was to get information on how outcrops could be identified from above in order to help targeting and interpretation of shallow subsurface sampling attempts on Mars by rovers like the planned ExoMars. During the analysis, outcrop indicators, such as albedo differences, rectangular blocks, protruding layers and steep walls were identified inside impact craters. Using shadow length measurements and analyzing density distribution of blocks, nearly vertical walls could also be identified even in images acquired under vertical viewing condition. There is a size dependent tendency in the occurrence of outcrops inside caters. Impact craters with diameters of 5-10 m may indicate a subsurface lithology that differs from that visible on the surface, while craters with diameter above 50 m may indicate subsurface layering. Many useful large outcrops are present inside craters above diameter of 100 m and are possible targets for detailed in-situ analysis. The depth that can be reached by the drill of ExoMars is exhumed by outcrops inside craters above 50-80 m diameter. The values presented here are valid only for Terra Meridiani since craters would excavate different subsurface layers in areas with different subsurface lithologies. Although future missions with the aim of subsurface sampling will probably land not at Terra Meridiani, but these terrains could be sedimentary plains too, so the experiences outlined in this work may still be useful there. The identified outcrops may help in the planning of in-situ work and also in the interpretation of results from drill activity.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'NASA\\'s Mars Exploration Program was redesigned in 2000, following the twin losses of the Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander in late 1999. The new science based program was grounded in community consensus based priorities and had as its aim understanding Mars as a system. The popular phrase used to describe the goals of the mission sequence was \"Follow the Water\". A new queue of missions was put in place for the decade 2001 - 2010 and a new community based competitive opportunity, the Mars Scout program, was initiated. The strategic mission implementation has been unchanged since the new program was announced in October 2000. Those projects successfully launched and deployed thus far include Mars Odyssey, the two Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity, Mars Reconnaissance Obiter and the Phoenix Scout Mission. The final project of the decade, the Mars Science Laboratory, is in the last stages of development with launch slated for the Fall of 2009. The President\\'s budget announced in February 2008 for Fiscal 2009, contained little in the way of definitive objectives for Mars program in the decade 2011-2020 and proposed to reduce the Mars budget drastically over the five year budget period. This paper will review the programmatic and scientific progress thus far in meeting the original objectives as outlined in October 2000. A look ahead to the potential missions and goals for the next decade will be provided with particular emphasis on the status of Mars Sample Return mission. Bibliography: G. Scott Hubbard, Firouz M.

The SAM investigation is designed to contribute substantially to the mission goal of quantitatively assessing the habitability of Mars as an essential step in the search for past or present life on Mars. SAM is a 40 kg instrument suite located in the interior of MSL's Curiosity rover. The SAM instruments are a quadrupole mass spectrometer, a tunable laser spectrometer, and a 6-column gas chromatograph all coupled through solid and gas processing systems to provide complementary information on the same samples. The SAM suite is able to measure a suite of light isotopes and to analyze volatiles directly from the atmosphere or thermally released from solid samples. In addition to measurements of simple inorganic compounds and noble gases SAM will conduct a sensitive search for organic compounds with either thermal or chemical extraction from sieved samples delivered by the sample processing system on the Curiosity rover's robotic arm.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Infrared spectral observations have yielded many important insights into the nature of Mars. However, spectral effects tied to surface roughness and particle size can make mineral deposits substantially more difficult to detect and identify than is generally known, including for current investigations. The effects hold for Mars and other planets, but here we focus on the impact on the exploration of Mars. Laboratory spectra of pure, smooth-surfaced minerals have previously been used to conclude that the 1996 Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) and the 2001 Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) will detect a mineral deposit that covers ~10% of a pixel. Those laboratory spectra have formed the foundation for modeling and interpretations of TES/THEMIS data and for development of the 2003 Mars rover MiniTES. Here, for the first time, we compare TES/THEMIS foundation data to laboratory, field, and unique airborne spectra of rough surfaces. We demonstrate that substantial, well-crystalline, regional mineral deposits, including rock outcrops, can be 100% exposed and remain undetected at the sensitivity of TES/THEMIS. We then detail the physics, which apply to all geologic materials. Previous studies have demonstrated the complicating physical effects for solids versus particulates for a range of minerals, including oxides, sulfates, carbonates, and each of the seven silicate classes. We identify three cases of spectral behavior that can impact interpretations: In Case 1, physical effects cause a target to be undetectable by a given infrared instrument (``infrared stealthy''). In Case 2, variations in spectral contrast mimic abundance variations, which confounds abundance mapping. In Case 3, alteration of the spectral band shape impacts compositional interpretations. Optically smooth materials will be well represented in TES/THEMIS/MiniTES identifications. Conversely, if a material forms an optically rough surface or sufficiently small particles on Mars, then it will be comparatively underrepresented or missed. Surface roughness occurs on three broad scales, and roughness at the grain scale can be a primary variable in whether a mineral is detectable. Nondetection of certain key minerals (e.g., carbonates) can significantly impact geologic and climatic interpretations and landing site selection. The TES/THEMIS detection threshold may be 10% coverage on the basis of specific laboratory samples, but for field measurements, that prediction represents an idealized lower bound. Interpretations built on nondetection should be revisited after defining the uncertainties in detection capabilities for specific instruments as applied to expected mineral surface textures on Mars, including at the grain scale. The impact on future measurement strategies (including MiniTES) should also be assessed.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"We tested rover science operations strategies to determine best practices for interrogating geologic sections where the bulk composition is igneous but depositional/emplacement processes range from sedimentary to volcanic. This scenario may mirror locations on Mars interrogated by mobile vehicles (e.g., Perseverance rover in Jezero crater). Two field teams studied a 60 m vertical outcrop on Iceland's Tjörnes peninsula as an analog for a Martian site containing interleaved layers of sedimentary and volcanic units. A Rover team commanded a human rover to execute observations based on common Mars rover sequences; the resulting data were used to characterize the geologic history of the location. Results were compared to that of a Tiger team using traditional terrestrial field methods to interrogate the same site. The goal was to understand which instruments, at what resolution, are required to assess the provenance of volcanic or sedimentary layers of similar chemical composition. Results suggest that, in a succession dominated by rocks having basaltic composition, current rover-driven decision-making protocols are sufficient to support a first-order interpretation of a sequence of sedimentary and volcanic layers. Two crucial data sets in maximizing science return in this scenario are (1) handlens-scale images revealing grain morphology and relationships and (2) data sets that allow comparison between surface and bulk geochemistry. Certain sedimentary features can be difficult to confidently identify if not viewed at a specific angle and resolution, and confident interpretations appear to require lateral scanning of beds at meter scales. This work illuminates the need for strategic planning, particularly of resource-intensive observations.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Volcano-ice interactions are hypothesized to be a possible cause of episodic flooding on ancient Mars and a potential contributor to its global dust inventory. However, little is known about how the products of volcano-ice interactions are eroded, transported, and deposited in Mars-relevant sedimentary systems. To better understand the distribution of the products of volcano-ice interactions in Mars-analog sedimentary environments, we investigated two glacio-fluvio-aeolian sedimentary transport pathways of different lengths in Iceland within the SANDE: Semi-Autonomous Navigation for Detrital Environments Mars-analog mission, using analytical techniques available to Mars rovers such as XRF, XRD, and VNIR. The first sedimentary system studied in 2019 is 10 km long and situated in the Þórisjökull area in SW Iceland. The second system, recently investigated in 2021, follows the 200 km long Jökulsá á Fjöllum river which extends from the Vatnajökull glacier and terminates in a delta fan on the Northern coast of Iceland. Both systems have basaltic source rocks with several source volcanoes forming during periods of glaciation, creating table mountains, tindars, and móberg sheets. Sediments analyzed at varying distances in the Þórisjökull sedimentary transect show variations in geochemistry indicative of sediment sorting and/or changes in sediment source between the subglacial volcanoes in the area. Gravel-sized grains are geochemically the most diverse and the most representative of source rock diversity in the area. Fluvial and aeolian sand grain chemistry and morphology are most similar to the quenched, glassy units of the subglacial volcanoes, becoming progressively more intermixed with the crystalline rocks from the local Skjaldbreiður shield volcano with increasing distance downstream. Tuffaceous materials are rarely present in the studied sediments of the 10 km Þórisjökull sedimentary transect, suggesting they may bypass the studied sites and deposit further downstream. Evidence of chemical weathering in the sediments deposited in this system was minimal. At this conference, new data from the Jökulsá á Fjöllum campaign will be compared to those of the shorter Þórisjökull transport pathway.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"While innovations in scientific instrumentation have pushed the boundaries of Mars rover mission capabilities, the increase in data complexity has pressured Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and future Mars rover operations staff to quickly analyze complex data sets to meet progressively shorter tactical and strategic planning timelines. MSLWEB is an internal data tracking tool used by operations staff to perform first pass analysis on MSL image sequences, a series of products taken by the Mast camera, Mastcam. Mastcam's multiband multispectral image sequences require more complex analysis compared to standard 3-band RGB images. Typically, these are analyzed using traditional methods to identify unique features within the sequence. Given the short time frame of tactical planning in which downlinked images might need to be analyzed (within 5-10 hours before the next uplink), there exists a need to triage analysis time to focus on the most important sequences and parts of a sequence. We address this need by creating products for MSLWEB that use novelty detection to help operations staff identify unusual data that might be diagnostic of new or atypical compositions or mineralogies detected within an imaging scene. This was achieved in two ways: 1) by creating products for each sequence to identify novel regions in the image, and 2) by assigning multispectral sequences a sortable novelty score. These new products provide colorized heat maps of inferred novelty that operations staff can use to rapidly review downlinked data and focus their efforts on analyzing potentially new kinds of diagnostic multispectral signatures. This approach has the potential to guide scientists to new discoveries by quickly drawing their attention to often subtle variations not detectable with simple color composites.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The NASA Perseverance Mars rover has been exploring Jezero crater since February 2021. During that time, several rocks with potential coatings were observed. Rock coatings can record the interactions of rock surfaces with atmosphere, regolith, and water, and are important targets for understanding environmental conditions. The SuperCam instrument uses multiple analytical techniques including Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), a microphone for obtaining acoustic data from the LIBS shockwave, remote micro-imagery (RMI), visible-near infrared (VISIR), Raman, and luminescence spectroscopy. On sols 75-83, SuperCam analyzed a flat paver rock called Nataani that appeared to have a dusty surface with shiny, dark-toned material underneath and ~cm-sized spots of splotchy coating. An initial 10-point LIBS raster with 30 laser pulses per point indicated a potential systematic change in composition with depth, a known signature of coatings and thin layers. To investigate this further, the team conducted two depth profile LIBS rasters consisting of 5-point LIBS rasters with 150 laser pulses per location to sample deeper into the rock. Two additional locations were analyzed with co-located LIBS, Raman, and VISIR. Acoustics data were also collected during the LIBS depth profile analyses. LIBS chemistry data indicate the surface may be relatively enriched in Mg, Mn, Cr, and possibly H, whereas the interior was relatively enriched in Si, Al, and Sr. Notably, the acoustic data did not show a systematic change in amplitude with depth; this suggests that the surface and interior materials had similar material properties, i.e. hardness, optical, and thermal properties. Raman spectra suggested the presence of amorphous silica but due to SuperCams long optical fiber, which also produces a weak signature of amorphous silica, this feature could not be clearly attributed to Nataani. VISIR spectra exhibit a feature attributable to H2O at 1.9 microns, similar to other targets in Jezero. Due to their larger spot sizes relative to LIBS, the fields of view for both Raman and VISIR may contain some signal from dust and/or uncoated rock. Efforts to better understand these signatures, including collection of additional LIBS and acoustics data on similar martian rocks and terrestrial analogs, are ongoing.',\n",

Over 28 sols of subjective mission time, the mission explored a terrestrial Mars analogue site with a remote science operations team, subject to realistic operational constraints, considering Earth-in-the-loop requirements, downlink timing and budgets, on-board resources, and instrument limitations. In that context, the mission also conducted an extensive set of experiments in employing rover science autonomy - capabilities where the rover decides for itself which data to gather, based on guidance from Earth but without complete specification of the targets. Such approaches have begun to be deployed in exploration missions, and can greatly enhance mission science return. These experiments aimed to understand under which operational circumstances, and for which kinds of observations, each of a suite of science autonomy capabilities was useful and practical. These included blind targeting of remote sensing instruments, autonomous geological scene classification and instrument targeting, visual target tracking, conditional sequencing, contingency activity lists, and precise rover return to previous positions. We present here a case study of these experiments and insights into applicability to rover mission planning.\",\n",

Viking data, experimental results, and inviscid flowfield computations were used to estimate the performance of the aerobrake. The MRSR mission requirements dictated a much lower entry speed and therefore a more benign environment than for the MESUR mission and can be accomplished with current materials.

       "    'abstract': \"The identification of putative ancient deltaic sedimentary systems on Mars has been both exciting and controversial. Our excitement is elicted by the potential provided by deltas as evidence for standing bodies of water associated with the deltas, and the resulting implications for both the ancient climate of Mars and ancient habitability. The controversy stems from how confident can we be in the identification of ancient deltaic systems from orbital data, and how robust are our assertions about the habitability potential of such settings. Delta systems in particular are key astrobiological targets because at their distal toes fine-grained sediment (ie., clays) settle from suspension in a lower energy setting and they are commonly characterised by high rates of sedimentation. This leads to high preservation potential of biosignatures. Targeting of future Mars rovers to investigate deltaic landing sites requires better understanding of these issues to reduce exploration risk. In this presentation, we describe the key criteria that enable us to make robust interpretations of deltaic stratigraphy and constrain delta evolution for martian systems. In particular, the past 10 years has seen in a revolution in our process understanding of terrestrial delta systems through a combination of field, experimental and numerical modelling studies. Analysis of martian deltas has much to gain from these results. We go on to consider why deltaic systems offer potential as astrobiological target paleoenvironments. We use the exhumed delta system (Hypanis delta system) at the termination of Hypanis Vallis, 11.8°N, 314.96°E as a case example. This system, situated in Xanthe Terra, comprises layered sedimentary rocks with an overall multi-lobate geometry and associated inverted channel networks. The Hypanis 'delta' is a proposed landing site for the ExoMars rover and also for the NASA 2020 mission.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Introduction: The ESA SPICE Service (ESS) based at the European Space and Astronomy Center (EASC) provides ESAs Solar System Exploration missions ancillary data and geometry information to the science community and to the science ground segments in the shape of SPICE data. Most of this data is three-dimensional, and its interpretation and visualization is one of the challenges faced by the ground segments that operate the spacecrafts and the scientists that study its data. Science Observations and contextual Data analysis of Planetary missions can be naturally accommodated into 3D visualizations. Virtual Reality (VR) brings an unprecedented level of interaction possible with these visualizations, and emerging VR platforms such as Oculus VR, Google Cardboard or Samsung Gear VR are making these technologies accessible to the wide public. VR might become in the near future, not only a tool for outreach and data visualization, but also a key part for spacecraft science operators, becoming a key element of the ground segments.The ESA SPICE Service: The ESA SPICE Service (ESS) leads the SPICE operations for ESA missions. The group generates the SPICE Kernel Datasets (SKDs) for missions in development (JUICE, ExoMars 2022, Hera, Comet-Interceptor, and EnVision), missions in operations (Mars Express, ExoMars 2016, BepiColombo, and Solar Orbiter) and legacy missions (Venus Express, Rosetta and SMART-1). ESS is also responsible for the generation of SPICE Kernels for INTEGRAL. Moreover, ESS provides SPICE support Kernels for Gaia and James Webb Space Telescope. ESS also provides tools for the exploitation of the SPICE Kernels, consultancy and support to the Science Ground Segments of the planetary missions, the Instrument Teams and the science community. The access point for the ESS activities, data and latest news can be found at the following site https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/spice. ESS works in partnership with NAIF.Virtual Reality Applications: Examples of applications of these technologies in operations are already available: the Mars rovers, especially Curiosity have embraced VR and Augmented Reality techniques (some applications are publicly available such as (Access Mars). New mission concepts such as recently selected Dragonfly (a NASA rotorcraft lander for Titan) have already started to develop operation concepts based on VR. Another example of a successful VR application is ESASky [2]. ESASky is a science driven discovery portal developed at ESAC providing full access to the entire sky as observed with Space astronomy missions that has VR extensions and capabilities.VR for Solar System Exploration: This contribution aims to describe the first steps of delivering advanced functionalities for VR tools created to access Solar System geometry, with particular emphasis on visualization of the science observations carried out by the ESA Planetary fleet on the Solar System (Mars Express, ExoMars2016, BepiColombo, Solar-Orbiter, Rosetta, SMART-1, JUICE, etc.). The functionalities will also include advanced functionalities for navigation and data selection in a VR space through peripherals like Oculus Touch.References: [1] Acton C. (1996) Planet.

The compositions of the major elements, reported as oxides (SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, TiO<SUB>2</SUB>, Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>, FeO<SUB>T</SUB>, MgO, CaO, Na<SUB>2</SUB>O, K<SUB>2</SUB>O), have been re-calibrated using a laboratory LIBS instrument, Mars-like atmospheric conditions, and a much larger set of standards (408) that span a wider compositional range than previously employed. The new calibration uses a combination of partial least squares (PLS1) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithms, together with a calibration transfer matrix to minimize differences between the conditions under which the standards were analyzed in the laboratory and the conditions on Mars. While the previous model provided good results in the compositional range near the average Mars surface composition, the new model fits the extreme compositions far better. Examples are given for plagioclase feldspars, where silicon was significantly over-estimated by the previous model, and for calcium-sulfate veins, where silicon compositions near zero were inaccurate. The uncertainties of major element abundances are described as a function of the abundances, and are overall significantly lower than the previous model, enabling important new geochemical interpretations of the data.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Visual navigation has received more and more attention in Mars landing. However, dust devils are active on Mars. The dust will make a great influence on visual navigation during the landing phase. In this paper, a simple but effective approach was proposed to remove the dust impact for visual navigation in Mars landing. This method was based on a model which was widely used to describe the scene radiance that was affected by different weather conditions. First the calculation method of transmission parameter was deduced from this model. Then the value of the global atmospheric light was estimated through the detection of most dust-opaque region. After all unknown variables were determined, the clear image was recovered by the corresponding formula and calculation method. For it is difficult to obtain the decent images that appear while the Mars rover enters the landing phase, a simulated dust environment was created in the lab and some images affected by dust were obtained to check the validity of this method. From the results of the experiments, the proposed approach can effectively eliminate the dust influences and provide clearer pictures. The clear images help to provide more precise data for visual navigation.',\n",

One of the most essential tasks of a rover is terrain traversing which requires the need of efficient suspension systems. This communication presents a suspension system giving degrees of freedom to every wheel with the help of linear actuators connected through bell crank levers. The actuation of linear actuators directly varies the height of every wheel from the chassis hence offering articulation to the rover. A control system is developed offering an algorithm for its autonomous actuation. This system proves instrumental for leveling of the chassis where any kind of slope, roll or pitch, may impute abstaining of payloads from efficient working.

       "    'abstract': 'One of the most profound discoveries in planetary exploration is the evidence for large quantities of liquid water on several bodies in our Solar System, aptly named \"Ocean Worlds\". In an effort to extrapolate our understanding of life on Earth to the cosmos, \"go to the water\" has become the guiding principle in our search for evidence of extraterrestrial life. Thus, Ocean Worlds have become key astrobiology targets, and many outstanding questions can only be answered through direct contact with their subsurface liquid water. <P />The challenges posed by robotic subsurface missions on Ocean Worlds are immense, and advanced Autonomy may be among the most demanding technology developments that will be required. The current state of practice for autonomous operations of Mars rovers and distant spacecraft, for example, are highly robust, deliberative, and protective; that is, the system makes a plan that is \"safe\" with respect to known uncertainties and promptly triggers a \"safe mode\" in the event of any anomalies. Ocean Worlds, however, present an environment that is far more uncertain, dynamic, and communication-constrained, which will require autonomy that is adaptive, reactive, and resilient. For example, the dynamic nature of plume ejecta on Enceladus or the harsh radiation of Europa prohibit human-in-the-loop control, especially during long-duration communication blackouts such as the two-week period during solar conjunction. Ocean World probes must be equipped with the ability to learnfrom their interactions with the environment, react to imminent hazards, and make real-time decisions to respond to anomalies. <P />Information for the Design Reference Mission report was synthesized additionally by Hiro Ono, Kalind Carpenter, Ben Hochman, Michael Wolf, John-Pierre de la Croix and John-Pierre Fleurial.',\n",

Fairén, Carlos González Silva, Jacek Wierzchos, Daniel Carrizo, Miguel Ángel Fernández-Martínez, Cristián Arenas-Fajardo, Maite Fernández-Sampedro, Carolina Gil-Lozano, Laura Sánchez-García, Carmen Ascaso. <P />The main scientific objective that guided the selection of the landing sites for the 2021 Mars rovers, Jezero Crater (NASA) and Oxia Planum (ESA), is the presence in both cases of a record of ancient and potentially habitable environments. Smectite clays are the preferred target to be investigated, since they have been detected at both sites and are known to preserve evidences of life on Earth. Here we report the first identification of subsurface wet smectites in the middle of the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert, the driest and oldest desert on Earth and a well-established Mars analog. Maintaining a constant water activity of 0.77 and a constant temperature of 17ºC, the clay layer is located only 30 cm under the surface, thermally and hydrically isolated from the extremely dry and UV-irradiated subaerial conditions typical of the hyperarid core of the Atacama. These clays are inhabited by at least 30 halophilic species of bacteria and archaea, forming small metabolically active colonies. In addition, the biosignatures analyses of the inspected clays may help inform decisions in the search for life in analog smectite-rich deposits on Mars, soon to be explored by rovers in search of ancient organic molecules and other potential biosignatures',\n",

The purpose of SAM-OCL is to determine the Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GCMS) signals of different materials composing the Mars Science Laboratory rover. In turn, this allows us to determine which GCMS signals originate from terrestrial contamination or rover material outgassing. The GCMS spectral library has several supplemental components, of which its descriptor spreadsheets are the most important, aimed to make SAM-OCL easily and readily accessible to users in and out of the Mars rover mission. One spreadsheet describes the contaminants that can be found in each file, while the other describes the information regarding each file. The library, along with its supplemental materials, is useful from an organizational and practical sense. Through them we are able to organize large volumes of GCMS data while breaking down the components that each material sample is made off. This allows us easy and fast access to information that will be critical when doing analysis in the data that the SAM instrumentation will obtain.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Panoramic camera systems on robots exploring the surface of Mars are used to collect images of terrain and rock outcrops which they encounter along their traverse. Image mosaics from these cameras are essential in mapping the surface geology and selecting locations for analysis by other instruments on the rover's payload. 2-D images do not truly portray the depth of field of features within an image, nor their 3-D geometry. This paper describes a new 3-D visualization software tool for geological analysis of Martian rover-derived Digital Outcrop Models created using photogrammetric processing of stereo-images using the Planetary Robotics Vision Processing tool developed for 3-D vision processing of ExoMars PanCam and Mars 2020 Mastcam-Z data. Digital Outcrop Models are rendered in real time in the Planetary Robotics 3-D Viewer PRo3D, allowing scientists to roam outcrops as in a terrestrial field campaign. Digitization of point, line, and polyline features is used for measuring the physical dimensions of geological features and communicating interpretations. Dip and strike of bedding and fractures is measured by digitizing a polyline along the contact or fracture trace, through which a best fit plane is plotted. The attitude of this plane is calculated in the software. Here we apply these tools to analysis of sedimentary rock outcrops and quantification of the geometry of fracture systems encountered by the science teams of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity and Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity. We show the benefits PRo3D allows for visualization and collection of geological interpretations and analyses from rover-derived stereo-images.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Carbonates form a very important mineral group in geobiological studies. They are a common mineral matrix for putative carbonaceous microfossils in Archean greenstone belts, form an important chemical deposit in seafloor hydrothermal systems, and are a common product in biomineralization processes. In many geobiological studies there is a specific need for simple characterization of carbonate composition while avoiding complex sample preparation or sample destruction. Raman spectroscopy is a highly versatile non-destructive technique enabling in-situ characterization of minerals and carbonaceous materials. It can be combined with confocal microscopy enabling high-resolution Raman mapping of entire rock thin sections, or can be integrated in submersibles and potentially Mars-rovers for direct field-based mineral identification. It is thus important that well-established spectral databases exist which enable unambiguous identification of a wide variety of carbonate minerals. The most common carbonates in the Ca-Mg-Fe system include the CaCO3 polymorphs calcite, aragonite, and vaterite, as well as the solid solutions CaMg(CO3)2-CaFe(CO3)2 (dolomite-ankerite) and MgCO3-FeCO3 (magnesite-siderite). Although various carbonate end-members have been studied exhaustively by Raman spectroscopy, a simple protocol for rapid distinction of various carbonate solid solutions is still lacking. Here we present a detailed study of Raman shifts in various carbonate standards of known composition in the Ca-Mg-Fe system. Carbonates with rhombohedral symmetry display a Raman spectrum with six characteristic vibrational modes - four of these represent vibrations within the (CO3)2- unit and two represent external vibrations of the crystal lattice. We show that Raman band shifts of internal mode 2ν2 (range 1725-1765 cm-1), and external modes T (range 170-215 cm-1) and L (range 285-330 cm-1) for siderite-magnesite and ankerite-dolomite solid solutions display distinct and well defined positive correlations with Mg number (Mg/Mg+Fe+Mn+Ca). Raman shifts calibrated as a function of Mg number were used in turn to evaluate the chemical composition of natural carbonate samples. In particular it is shown that detailed micron-resolution Raman maps can be generated of carbonate crystal-zonation in hydrothermally altered sedimentary deposits from Archean greenstone belts. Large spectral-range analysis (140-2000 cm-1) in static-mode (centered at 1150 cm-1) allows for combined Raman mapping of both carbonate-composition (2ν2, T, L modes) as well as kerogen structural ordering (D1-D4 and G modes in the range 1100-1700 cm-1), and therefore allows for simultaneous characterization of putative organic microfossils and associated carbonate matrix in metamorphosed Archean rock samples. Finally, it will be shown that these carbonate solid solutions can be distinguished from other end-member carbonates such as calcite, vaterite and the orthorhombic polymorph aragonite.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Rosalind Franklin rover, set to be launched in 2028, will explore the Martian surface and subsurface in Oxia Planum to search for signs of life. It is the first Mars rover equipped with a drill system capable of drilling down to a depth of 2 m. It will collect core samples of astrobiological interest at different depths in the 0-2m range and deliver them to a suite of analytical instruments. The drill system also hosts Ma_MISS, a miniaturized spectrometer for investigating subsurface mineralogy and stratigraphy [1]. Characterization of the subsurface is crucial for properly understanding the sample environment, and can be complemented and augmented with information about the mechanical properties of the soil and subsurface rocks. While there is no instrument specifically dedicated to measuring the mechanical properties of the subsurface rocks/materials on board the rover, the drill system itself grants an outstanding opportunity to gain important insights on the mechanical behavior of the rocks it bores through [2,3]. Indeed, during its operation, the drill provides a wealth of information in the form of engineering telemetry data. Drill telemetry includes data such as readings from torque and force sensors, position resolvers and motor currents and speed. To extract useful information from drill telemetry at Mars, suitable analysis techniques need to be developed and validated before the launch. To accomplish this goal, we are using telemetry data from drilling tests performed with the rover GTM (Ground Test Model). The GTM is hosted in the MTS (Mars Terrain Simulator) in ALTEC Turin premises. Drilling tests are performed with the GTM on the MTS\\' Drilling Facility: a raised platform with a Drilling Well that can be filled with different rocks and sand to simulate a varied stratigraphy. Using data from these tests, we can develop, optimize and validate data analysis techniques tailored for this specific drill system, trying to extract as much useful information as possible. We are currently focusing on the analysis of data from drilling test held in February 2023, and will present the first results of this analysis and the techniques used. We computed characteristic parameters such as the mechanical power and specific energy spent during drilling operations, which allow the differentiation of the various layers with different properties.

       "    'abstract': 'The selection of Meridiani Planum and Gusev crater as the Mars Exploration Rover landing sites took over 2 years, involved broad participation of the science community via four open workshops, and narrowed an initial ~155 potential sites (80-300 × 30 km) to four finalists based on science and safety. Engineering constraints important to the selection included (1) latitude (10°N-15°S) for maximum solar power, (2) elevation (less than -1.3 km) for sufficient atmosphere to slow the lander, (3) low horizontal winds, shear, and turbulence in the last few kilometers to minimize horizontal velocity, (4) low 10-m-scale slopes to reduce airbag spin-up and bounce, (5) moderate rock abundance to reduce abrasion or strokeout of the airbags, and (6) a radar-reflective, load-bearing, and trafficable surface safe for landing and roving that is not dominated by fine-grained dust. The evaluation of sites utilized existing as well as targeted orbital information acquired from the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey. Three of the final four landing sites show strong evidence for surface processes involving water and appear capable of addressing the science objectives of the missions, which are to determine the aqueous, climatic, and geologic history of sites on Mars where conditions may have been favorable to the preservation of evidence of possible prebiotic or biotic processes. The evaluation of science criteria placed Meridiani and Gusev as the highest-priority sites. The evaluation of the three most critical safety criteria (10-m-scale slopes, rocks, and winds) and landing simulation results indicated that Meridiani and Elysium Planitia are the safest sites, followed by Gusev and Isidis Planitia.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"As most every person at this conference can appreciate, spectroscopy, especially at the undergraduate level, is often considered one of the most difficult subjects to undertake and, due to this mentality, is often avoided at all costs. To overcome this stigma and make the material resonate with undergraduates, it is important to give them avenues by which to actually get involved in the processes of spectroscopy. In this way, the students become invested in some aspect of the subject which is applicable to their own personal interests. At Missouri S\\\\&amp;T, this is achieved in multiple ways. In the research lab, students are given tasks that align with their interest, but also achieve a common goal of a spectrometer enhancement or molecular target of interest in microwave spectroscopy. They are given the tools and instruction to succeed as well as the leeway to fail in a project as this is the cornerstone of discovery. When given this freedom, they become leads in a project, guided and mentored by both the graduate students and myself. If a student is interested in teaching, we have had undergraduates create physical chemistry labs and instruct them in order to guide other students through the process of learning, thereby augmenting their own knowledge. For expanded or more general undergraduate spectroscopy outreach, I serve as the physical chemistry lab instructor and the Associate Advisor of our university's Mars Rover Design Team, which always builds and implements an onboard spectrometer for field analyses. The overarching theme of the talk is to get students interested early and keep them involved. The university helps with this by having programs that will get the students involved as young as the high school level. How we have utilized these programs, reached, and kept student interest while also mitigating the costs of such endeavors at Missouri S\\\\&amp;T will be discussed.\",\n",

The antidust self-cleaning film is an effective method to reduce the deposition of dust and ensure the operational performance of the equipment. In this study, perfluorocarbon (PFC) film can be used as a potential self-cleaning film because of its excellent properties such as stability and low surface energy and was prepared using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The dust removal efficiency of the PFC film-coated sample and the bare glass substrate sample was measured and calculated by three different masses of the dust vertical free-fall approach. The results demonstrated that, by comparison, the self-cleaning film exhibited excellent dust removal performance. Specifically, for the PFC film, the dust removal efficiency was 88.86%, 92.80%, and 98.11%, and optical transmittance was about 92%; these values are better than that of the glass substrate. Moreover, the dust adhesion and resistance mechanism was explored and analyzed, which indicated that decreasing the surface roughness and surface energy can effectively reduce the adhesion of the dust on the sample surface. The results will be of major theoretical significance and practical engineering value for long-term service in power systems that are placed in a dusty environment.',\n",

Glasses are potential components of this amorphous material and in this study, basaltic tephras from several hydro- and glaciovolcanic centers, as well as impact melts from India's Lonar Crater, were examined using thin section petrography, visible and near-infrared reflectance and mid-wave infrared emission spectroscopy as well as measuring major and minor element chemistry of representative samples using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. The objectives of this study have been to look for distinguishing characteristics between volcanic and impact glasses and to determine features that indicate whether the glasses are fresh or altered using methods available on current and planned Mars rovers. Spectral features in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) that can be used as indicators of alteration include the development of hydration features at 1.9 and ∼3 μm and a feature attributed to ferric oxide development at 0.48 μm. In the mid-wave infrared, it was observed that glass-rich tephra field samples did not display a broad, disordered glass feature near 9-10 μm (as is observed in pristine basaltic glasses) but rather a doublet with centers near 9.5 and 11 μm attributed in earlier work to incipient devitrification into SiO<SUB>4</SUB> chain and sheet structures respectively. A tentative observation was made that the Si-O bending feature, observed in all the sample spectra near 22 μm was broader in the hydro- and glaciovolcanic glass samples than in the impact glass samples. Hydro- and glaciovolcanic glass-rich tephra samples were used as library spectra in linear deconvolution analyses of Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (MGS TES) surface spectral types. These incipiently devitrified glass spectra were selected for all of the surface types and formed close to 40% of the N. Acidalia Planitia spectral type.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Blind field tests of the Field Integration Design and Operations (FIDO) prototype Mars rover were carried out 7-16 May 2000. A Core Operations Team (COT), sequestered at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory without knowledge of test site location, prepared command sequences and interpreted data acquired by the rover. Instrument sensors included a stereo panoramic camera, navigational and hazard-avoidance cameras, a color microscopic imager, an infrared point spectrometer, and a rock coring drill. The COT designed command sequences, which were relayed by satellite uplink to the rover, and evaluated instrument data. Using aerial photos and Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data, and information from the rover sensors, the COT inferred the geology of the landing site during the 18 sol mission, including lithologic diversity, stratigraphic relationships, environments of deposition, and weathering characteristics. Prominent lithologic units were interpreted to be dolomite-bearing rocks, kaolinite-bearing altered felsic volcanic materials, and basalt. The color panoramic camera revealed sedimentary layering and rock textures, and geologic relationships seen in rock exposures. The infrared point spectrometer permitted identification of prominent carbonate and kaolinite spectral features and permitted correlations to outcrops that could not be reached by the rover. The color microscopic imager revealed fine-scale rock textures, soil components, and results of coring experiments. Test results show that close-up interrogation of rocks is essential to investigations of geologic environments and that observations must include scales ranging from individual boulders and outcrops (microscopic, macroscopic) to orbital remote sensing, with sufficient intermediate steps (descent images) to connect in situ and remote observations.',\n",

One of the objectives of the Mars Surface Composition Detector (MarSCoDe) onboard the rover is to investigate mineral compositions on the Martian surface by measuring the near-infrared reflectance spectra. Before conducting spectral interpretation, in-flight data calibration is a crucial step due to the significant differences between the laboratory and the Martian environment. The work of the MarSCoDe spectrometer is based on an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF). The temperature variation of the AOTF could induce wavelength offset, making mineral identification uncertain. We first analyzed the viewing geometry of the spectral measurements of the calibration targets on the Mars rover according to its attitude to identify the anomalous data. The wavelength offsets were then determined by fitting the absorption positions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> at ~1400 and ~2000 nm, representing the primary composition of the Martian atmosphere. The results showed 2–8 nm wavelength offsets, which correlated well with AOTF temperatures. The artifacts were removed in the wavelength-corrected reflectance spectra, which is critical to identify the material types on Mars, especially water-related minerals.',\n",

RTV 655 has demonstrated superiority to other polymers due to its unique range of material properties namely mechanical stability between -115 and 204 °C and UV radiation tolerance. As a result, it has been the number one choice for many space-related missions. However, due to the high mass density and the natural tendency for electrostatic charging RTV materials have caused complications by attracting and retaining dust particles (Sabri et al., 2008). In the current project we have investigated the relevant properties of polymer-reinforced (crosslinked) silica aerogels with the objective of substituting RTV-based calibration targets with an aerogel based design. The lightweight, mechanical strength, ability to accept color pigments, and extremely low dust capture makes polyurea crosslinked aerogels a strong candidate as a chromatic standard for extraterrestrial missions. For this purpose, the reflection spectra, gravimetric analysis, and low temperature response of metal oxide pigmented, polyurea crosslinked silica aerogels have been investigated and reported here.',\n",

The scientific goals of the Pancam investigation are to assess the high-resolution morphology, topography, and geologic context of each MER landing site, to obtain color images to constrain the mineralogic, photometric, and physical properties of surface materials, and to determine dust and aerosol opacity and physical properties from direct imaging of the Sun and sky. Pancam also provides mission support measurements for the rovers, including Sun-finding for rover navigation, hazard identification and digital terrain modeling to help guide long-term rover traverse decisions, high-resolution imaging to help guide the selection of in situ sampling targets, and acquisition of education and public outreach products. The Pancam optical, mechanical, and electronics design were optimized to achieve these science and mission support goals. Pancam is a multispectral, stereoscopic, panoramic imaging system consisting of two digital cameras mounted on a mast 1.5 m above the Martian surface. The mast allows Pancam to image the full 360° in azimuth and +/-90° in elevation. Each Pancam camera utilizes a 1024 × 1024 active imaging area frame transfer CCD detector array. The Pancam optics have an effective focal length of 43 mm and a focal ratio of f/20, yielding an instantaneous field of view of 0.27 mrad/pixel and a field of view of 16° × 16°. Each rover's two Pancam ``eyes'' are separated by 30 cm and have a 1° toe-in to provide adequate stereo parallax. Each eye also includes a small eight position filter wheel to allow surface mineralogic studies, multispectral sky imaging, and direct Sun imaging in the 400-1100 nm wavelength region. Pancam was designed and calibrated to operate within specifications on Mars at temperatures from -55° to +5°C. An onboard calibration target and fiducial marks provide the capability to validate the radiometric and geometric calibration on Mars.\",\n",

More recently, NASA's Mars Program has stated that a Mars rover mission known as 'Mars 2020' would be flown to Mars (in 2020) to accomplish a subset of the goals specified by the NRC, and the recent report of the Mars 2020 Science Definition Team (SDT) has recommended that the mission accomplish broad and rigorous in situ science, including seeking biosignatures, acquiring a diverse set of samples intended to address a range of Mars science questions and storing them in a cache for potential return to Earth at a later time, and other engineering goals to constrain costs and support future human exploration. In some ways Mars 2020 will share planetary protection requirements with the Mars Science Laboratory mission that landed in 2012, which included landing site constraints based on the presence of a perennial heat source (the MMRTG) aboard the lander/rover. In a very significant way, however, the presence of a sample-cache and the potential that Mars 2020 will be the first mission in the chain that will return a sample from Mars to Earth. Thus Mars 2020 will face more stringent requirements aimed at keeping the mission from returning Earth contamination with the samples from Mars. Mars 2020 will be looking for biosignatures of ancient life, on Mars, but will also need to be concerned with the potential to detect extant biosignatures or life itself within the sample that is eventually returned. If returned samples are able to unlock wide-ranging questions about the geology, surface processes, and habitability of Mars that cannot be answered by study of meteorites or current mission data, then either the returned samples must be free enough of Earth organisms to be releasable from a quarantine facility or the planned work of sample scientists, including high- and low-T geochemistry, igneous and sedimentary petrology, mineral spectroscopy, and astrobiology, will have to be accomplished within a containment facility. The returned samples also need to be clean of Earth organisms to avoid the potential that Earth contamination will mask the potential for martian life to be detected, allowing only non-conclusive or false-negative results. The requirements placed on the Mars 2020 mission to address contamination control in a life-detection framework will be one of the many challenges faced in this potential first step in Mars sample return.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Global magmatic trends inferred from gamma-ray, visible/near-infrared, and thermal infrared spectrometers on Mars-orbiting spacecraft have been used to constrain planetary petrogenetic processes and global thermal evolution models. Inferred magmatic trends include temporal variations in the relative proportions of low-Ca and high-Ca pyroxenes, and in the abundances of potassium (and total alkalis), silica, FeO* (total iron expressed as FeO), and thorium. These patterns are evaluated for consistency with the compositions of surface igneous rocks of different ages analyzed by Mars rovers and of martian meteorites. Trends of decreasing low-Ca pyroxene/total pyroxene ratios and of decreasing potassium (and total alkalis), with time are generally supported by surface rock analyses. However, significant differences in the GRS-measured silica in Amazonian volcanoes and in martian meteorites of equivalent age result from contamination by silica-rich dust and are problematic for a silica trend. Comparison of FeO* in Noachian and Amazonian surface data shows no decrease. An inferred temporal trend in thorium is in conflict with the complex enrichment and depletion patterns of incompatible trace elements in martian meteorites of various ages. A dearth of analyses of Hesperian-age surface rocks precludes a firm evaluation of inferred Noachian-Hesperian trends and Hesperian-Amazonian trends, but abundant Noachian rocks and a few Hesperian rocks at rover sites, and Amazonian martian meteorites, collectively representing at least 16 surface locations, afford useful comparisons with orbital remote-sensing data.',\n",

The MRC focuses on the adventure of learning and discovery, asking participating teams to propose their own scientific mission to Mars, design a rover to carry it out, and present a mock-up at an open house. The curriculum is structured to be inquiry-based throughout. The “students choose the mission” structure is highly engaging. The latter half of the curriculum presents the Engineering Design Process and walks the students through the steps of designing and engineering a spacecraft/rover to meet the mission objectives chosen by the students. Students are introduced to engineering using the design-project approach. The six-week project period culminates in a public celebration at which students present their missions to members of the community including undergraduate and graduate students in science, engineering, and education fields; university faculty in these fields; and professionals from associated industries.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Mars rovers are the key to Mars exploration missions. In order to achieve long-time autonomous roving and perform science operations, Mars rovers need to have the capability of high-precision autonomous navigation. According to the characteristics of the Martian environment, an innovative scheme of strap-down inertial navigation system/celestial navigation system (SINS/CNS) deep integration for the Mars rover and its implementation are proposed. First, the large field of view (FOV) star sensor is utilized to assist the attitude matrix of SINS by continually observing and correcting the misalignment angles and gyro drifts. Thus, the high-precision mathematic reference is obtained. Then, the star sensor makes use of the reference provided by SINS to obtain the local position vector. The rover's position and attitude can be determined by CNS. On the basis of the mathematics reference, the innovative scheme of SINS/CNS deep integration which takes full advantage of the navigation information of each subsystem is presented. Moreover, the errors of inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the navigation parameters in SINS are estimated and corrected. And the deep integration of SINS/CNS is performed. Compared to the optimal integration mode, this scheme improves navigation accuracy. In the end, the simulation results indicate that this scheme is steady and reliable.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) data were used to retrieve scattering parameters of surfaces traversed by the Opportunity Mars rover, as well as adjacent areas. Our estimates agree with those retrieved by Johnson et al. [2006] using Opportunity's Panoramic Camera data, and we are able to extend estimates of the Hapke single particle scattering albedo and asymmetry parameter (from the one-term Henyey Greenstein single particle phase function) to a greater spectral resolution and spectral range. This analysis allows us to distinguish between surface units that otherwise look relatively uniform spectrally. This work also provides photometric functions essential for converting spectra to a single viewing geometry which will yield more accurate spectral comparisons. Our method involves simultaneously modeling surface and atmospheric contributions, iterating through surface scattering parameters until a Levenberg-Marquardt least squares best fit is achieved. Retrieved single scattering albedos range from 0.42 to 0.57 (0.5663 - 2.2715 micrometers), and retrieved asymmetry parameters range from -0.27 to -0.17 (moderately backscattering). All surfaces become more backscattering with increasing wavelength. Further, the northern and western portions of Victoria crater's ejecta apron are more backscattering than surrounding regions, indicating a change in physical properties. In images taken when the rover traversed this unit, a surface with small ripples and a dense cover of hematitic spherules is apparent, providing agreement with lab experiments by Johnson et al. [2006] showing increased backscattering with the addition of hematitic spherules. The CRISM-derived scattering parameters also show that bedrock-dominated surfaces are less backscattering than soil-covered surfaces.\",\n",

On the mixed terrain of hard rock and soft soil, the movement of hard rock will affect the traction performance of the rigid wheels of Mars rover. According to the different effects of the hard stones on the traction performance of rigid wheels, stones are divided into three types. The static sinkage of rigid wheels is calculated according to the Bekker bearing model, and the calculation formula of sliding sinkage of rigid wheels and hard stone sinkage is proposed. The type of hard stones is determined by comparing the sinkage of hard stones and rigid wheels. Finally, three kinds of hard stones with slip ratios of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.7 were substituted into the single wheel simulation platform and the soil trough experiment platform for simulation and experiment. The results show that on mixed terrain, the error of simulation and experimental results of fixed hard stones under three slip rates is below 5.4%, the error of drawbar pull in simulation and experimental results of movable hard stones is above 126%, and the error of simulation and experimental results of scattered small hard stones is below 2%, which verifies the effectiveness of the hard stone particle size division model.',\n",

Integrated studies include comparison of VIS-IR spectra obtained on the ground and observed lithologic endmembers to remotely sensed data and spectral endmembers (Deal et al., this Conf.), development of a topographic model from stereo imaging, alteration of basalts and relationships between ash deposits and basalts, including formation of duricrusts, thermal imaging and development of a thermal model, and characterization of extant and fossilized biological activity associated with sulfurous hydrothermal vents. Analyses to examine active biology at the hydrothermal vents include DNA amplification and identification using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) methods and FISH (fluorescence in-situ hybridization). Morphological evidence of entombment of microbes will be sought in mineralized crusts associated with the hydrothermal deposits.

Because of its advantages of high measurement accuracy, efficiency, non-contact, large measurement range, and the ability to measure a large number of points at the same time, multi-view stereo vision measurement is applied to the dynamic test task of communication antenna pointing accuracy. To avoid the effects of the traditional self-calibration model on the 3D measurement accuracy, a novel close-range photogrammetry without traditional self-calibration measurement model is proposed. In order to determine the relative orientation relationship between the communication antenna coordinate system and the rover coordinate system, it is necessary to paste a large number of visual feature points on the communication antenna and the rover, and calibrate the three-dimensional coordinates in their respective coordinate systems. The calibration process is described in detail. It has been verified that the measurement accuracy of the system for the communication antenna pointing is better than 0.02°, and the measurement frequency is faster than 12 Hz, which effectively guarantees the ground test task of the lunar and Mars rover.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Automatic terrain recognition in Mars rover images is an important problem not just for navigation, but for scientists interested in studying rock types, and by extension, conditions of the ancient Martian paleoclimate and habitability. Existing approaches to label Martian terrain either involve the use of non-expert annotators producing taxonomies of limited granularity (e.g. soil, sand, bedrock, float rock, etc.), or rely on generic class discovery approaches that tend to produce perceptual classes such as rover parts and landscape, which are irrelevant to geologic analysis. Expert-labeled datasets containing granular geological/geomorphological terrain categories are rare or inaccessible to public, and sometimes require the extraction of relevant categorical information from complex annotations. In order to facilitate the creation of a dataset with detailed terrain categories, we present a self-supervised method that can cluster sedimentary textures in images captured from the Mast camera onboard the Curiosity rover (Mars Science Laboratory). We then present a qualitative analysis of these clusters and describe their geologic significance via the creation of a set of granular terrain categories. The precision and geologic validation of these automatically discovered clusters suggest that our methods are promising for the rapid classification of important geologic features and will therefore facilitate our long-term goal of producing a large, granular, and publicly available dataset for Mars terrain recognition.',\n",

In contrast, sedimentary rocks at Meridiani formed in the presence of groundwater and occasional surface water, and many Columbia Hills rocks at Gusev underwent aqueous alteration during the Late Noachian, approximately coeval with a wide variety of geomorphic indicators that indicate a wetter and likely warmer environment. Two-toned rocks, elevated ventifacts, and perched and undercut rocks indicate localized deflation of the Gusev plains and deposition of an equivalent amount of sediment into craters to form hollows, suggesting average erosion rates of ~0.03 nm/yr. Erosion of Hesperian craters, modification of Late Amazonian craters, and the concentration of hematite concretions in the soils of Meridiani yield slightly higher average erosion rates of 1-10 nm/yr in the Amazonian. These erosion rates are 2-5 orders of magnitude lower than the slowest continental denudation rates on Earth, indicating that liquid water was not an active erosional agent. Erosion rates for Meridiani just before deposition of the sulfate-rich sediments and other eroded Noachian areas are comparable with slow denudation rates on Earth that are dominated by liquid water. Available data suggest the climate change at the landing sites from wet and likely warm to dry and desiccating occurred sometime between the Late Noachian and the beginning of the Late Hesperian (3.7-3.5 Ga).',\n",

Currently, the SRG operates with a heater head temperature of 650 °C and is fabricated from the nickel base superalloy 718. This temperature is at the limit of Alloy 718's capability, and any planned increase in temperature will be contingent on identifying a more capable material from which to fabricate the heater head. To this end, an assessment of material candidates was performed assuming a range of heater head temperatures. The chosen alternative material candidates will be discussed, along with the development efforts needed to ensure that these materials can meet the demanding system requirements of long-duration operation in hostile environments.\",\n",

We were motivated toward helping with an important NASA Mars rover mission task -- replacing laborious manual path planning with automatic navigation of the rover on the Mars terrain. The goal of the automatic segmentations was to identify an obstacle map on the Mars terrain to enable automatic path planning for the rover. The automatic segmentation was first explored with two different segmentation methods: one based on pixel luminance, and the other based on pixel altitude generated through stereo image processing. The third automatic segmentation was achieved by combining these two types of image segmentation. Human manual segmentation of Martian terrain images was used for evaluating the effectiveness of the combined automatic segmentation as well as for determining how different humans segment the same images. Comparisons between two different segmentations, manual or automatic, were measured using a similarity metric, S<SUB>AB</SUB>. Based on this metric, the combined automatic segmentation did fairly well in agreeing with the manual segmentation. This was a demonstration of a positive step towards automatically creating the accurate obstacle maps necessary for automatic path planning and rover navigation.',\n",

The HMD is a compact, low-mass (1.5 kg), and low-power instrument (5 W) suitable for Mars application. Compared with orbiter-based instruments with low horizontal resolution (5-10 km), the HMD will offer high resolution (2 m) that can identify optimal sampling sites for the presence of hydrated minerals. From field testing with reduced radio frequency (RF) power (P <SUB>rf</SUB> = 10 mW), the HMD demonstrated detection of shallow buried gypsum samples. When developed with full RF power, the HMD could potentially detect hydrates down to depths of 2 m (P <SUB>rf</SUB> = 1 W) or 4 m (P <SUB>rf</SUB> = 36 W) in Martian soil. Unlike conventional dielectric spectrometers, which require small amounts of the sample (5-10 g) to be placed inside sample cells, the HMD will detect hydrated minerals by scanning over the Mars surface mounted on a rover platform (&lt;1 m above ground) without any sample preparation. This capability will allow future rovers to rapidly assess the scientific potential of field sites. Compared with optical techniques that are limited to surface exposed mineralogical features that could be obscured by dust and weathering products, the HMD will detect bulk subsurface hydrated minerals along the rover traverse irrespective of surface obscuration. The HMD (TRL 4) is a proof-of-concept instrument that can be developed and matured for future Mars rover missions.',\n",

This causes huge scientific losses, but also, contrary to appearances, political losses. The better cooperation between national space agencies could be beneficial for the space exploration and for national space programs.Fortunately, recently private companies represent a new approach. The success of Spacex is not an example of a unique genius approach. It is a result of simple application of common sense to the astronautics. Similar breakthroughs have been observed many times when a technology has become so mundane that a simple economic approach can be applied to it. The best example was the Ford's approach to car production in the beginning of XX century. The success of privates companies in the development of space rockets still seems be ignored by decision makers.The better cooperation between space agencies could be beneficial for the space exploration and for national space programs. Instead of independent attempts to develop the technology already developed by others, the decisions makers could consider buying ready products, buying licences, exchanging of technology, etc. Why do not try the barter of Rosetta for Cassini? Why do not develop a new version of Huygens lander and barter it for Curiosity rover?It hardly to calculate the second copy of the Curiosity (the Martian rover), but evidently it would be much cheaper than the R&amp;D+first copy's production cost (2.5 billion US), probably not higher than 1 billion US. The rationalization of space expenditures would allow a significant acceleration of the planetary research. I believe that with a small increase in spending by the space agencies with a decisive increase of cooperation, it is possible to achieve several Mars rovers (of the Curiosity class) on Mars, Titan or Enceladus.Acknowledgements: The research is supported by BST fund of University of Warsaw.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A Martian rover capable of analyzing images autonomously could traverse greater path lengths and return data with greater scientific content. A more intelligent rover could, for example, automatically select targets of interest (e.g., rocks, layers), return spectral or high-resolution image data of these targets at the same time, remove less interesting or redundant parts of images before transmitting them, and provide compact information or representations of its environment. Three prototype algorithms, a horizon detector, a rock detector, and a layer detector have been developed and tested during the 1999 Marsokhod rover field test in Silver Lake, California. The results are encouraging and demonstrate the potential savings in time as well as the potential increase in the amount of relevant science data returned in each command cycle.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Recent aeolian bedforms such as dunes and ripples are common on Mars and occur across a scale range of centimetres to kilometres. Aeolian bedforms provide a mobility hazard to Mars rovers, such as the ESA ExoMars rover, which will launch in 2020 to either Mawrth Vallis or Oxia Planum. However, both sites contain numerous aeolian bedforms, mainly with simple ripple-like morphologies, and wavelengths of meters to tens of metres. The larger examples are 'Transverse Aeolian Ridges' (TARs), a few metres high and up to a few tens of metres across. TARs present a serious, but recognized and (hopefully) avoidable, rover mobility hazard that can be assessed using orbital data. Both sites also host smaller (1-4 m across) bedforms of similar ripple-like morphology, but it is unknown whether these bedforms will be traversable by the ExoMars rover: they are too small to be resolved in even the best Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) available. Here, we estimate the heights of these small bedforms by comparison with similar features observed by previous Mars rovers. We use rover-based stereo imaging from the NASA Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Opportunity and PRo3D software, a 3D visualisation and analysis tool, to measure the size and height of ripple-like bedforms in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars. These are good analogues for the smaller bedforms at the ExoMars rover candidate landing sites. We find that bedform height scales linearly with length (as measured across the bedform, perpendicular to the crest ridge) with a ratio of about 1:15. Using 25cm/pixel HiRISE images, we measured small aeolian bedforms at the Oxia Planum candidate landing site, finding them to be similar in length and morphology to those at Meridiani Planum. This allows us to infer the heights of bedforms at the ExoMars sites simply by measuring their lengths in HiRISE images. These data can then be used to explore the traversability of this site. Our method suggests that most of the bedforms studied in Oxia Planum have ridge crests higher than 15 cm, but lower than 25 cm. Hence, if the tallest bedforms the ExoMars rover will be able to safely cross are only 15 cm high, then the Oxia Planum site studied here contains mostly impassable bedforms. However, if the rover can safely traverse 25 cm high bedforms, then most bedforms here will be smaller than this threshold. Finally, our results show that the mini-TARs have length/height ratios similar to TARs in general. Hence, these bedforms should probably be classified simply as 'small TARs', and are not a discrete population or sub-type of aeolian bedforms.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"On the NASA 2020 rover mission to Jezero crater, the remote determination of the texture, mineralogy and chemistry of rocks is essential to quickly and thoroughly characterize an area and to optimize the selection of samples for return to Earth. As part of the Perseverance payload, SuperCam is a suite of five techniques that provide critical and complementary observations via Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), Time-Resolved Raman and Luminescence (TRR/L), visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (VISIR), high-resolution color imaging (RMI), and acoustic recording (MIC). SuperCam operates at remote distances, primarily 2-7 m, while providing data at sub-mm to mm scales. We report on SuperCam's science objectives in the context of the Mars 2020 mission goals and ways the different techniques can address these questions. The instrument is made up of three separate subsystems: the Mast Unit is designed and built in France; the Body Unit is provided by the United States; the calibration target holder is contributed by Spain, and the targets themselves by the entire science team. This publication focuses on the design, development, and tests of the Mast Unit; companion papers describe the other units. The goal of this work is to provide an understanding of the technical choices made, the constraints that were imposed, and ultimately the validated performance of the flight model as it leaves Earth, and it will serve as the foundation for Mars operations and future processing of the data.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The martian surface is a natural laboratory for testing our understanding of the physics of aeolian (wind-related) processes in an environment different from that of Earth. Martian surface markings and atmospheric opacity are time-variable, indicating that fine particles at the surface are mobilized regularly by wind. Regolith (unconsolidated surface material) at the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity's landing site has been affected greatly by wind, which has created and reoriented bedforms, sorted grains, and eroded bedrock. Aeolian features here preserve a unique record of changing wind direction and wind strength. Here we present an in situ examination of a martian bright wind streak, which provides evidence consistent with a previously proposed formational model for such features. We also show that a widely used criterion for distinguishing between aeolian saltation- and suspension-dominated grain behaviour is different on Mars, and that estimated wind friction speeds between 2 and 3ms<SUP>-1</SUP>, most recently from the northwest, are associated with recent global dust storms, providing ground truth for climate model predictions.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A key goal of the ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin is to analyze accessible hydrated mineral deposits using panoramic multiscale and multispectral imagery. We conducted a multiscale spectroscopic study on hydrothermally-altered basalt-hosted soils in the geothermal area of Námafjall in northern Iceland. Basaltic lavas here that have experienced first-order geochemical alteration produce a variety of cm-to-meter scale poorly crystalline alteration patterns. The resulting unconsolidated sediments provide a natural analogue material to investigate intimately mixed soils comprising multiple poorly crystalline hydrated phases. We use emulator instruments which replicate the capabilities of the ExoMars 2022 Panoramic Camera (PanCam), the Infrared Spectrometer for ExoMars (ISEM), and the CLose-UP Imager (CLUPI), alongside Raman, aerial, and X-Ray Fluorescence spectroscopic data to investigate how the detection of these mixed basalt-derived alteration phases varies as a function of spatial and spectral scale. We find soils at our study site to be comprised of unconsolidated sediments including Al-OH minerals, hydrated silica, and a variety of ferric oxides, all of which Rosalind Franklin will likely encounter along its traverse at Oxia Planum. We report on (i) the synergy and limitations between Mars rover instrument emulators as an integral part of mission preparation, (ii) how the mixed nature of these hydrothermally-altered soils affects resulting mineralogical interpretations at multiple scales, and (iii) geochemical inferences that can be made using ExoMars 2022 imaging emulators.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Ancient (4.1-3.7-billion-year-old) layered sedimentary rocks on Mars are rich in clay minerals which formed from aqueous alteration of the Martian surface. Many of these sedimentary rocks appear to be composed of vertical sequences of rocks containing Fe/Mg clay minerals overlain by rocks with Al clay minerals that altogether resemble paleosols (ancient, buried soils) from Earth. The types and properties of minerals in paleosols can be used to constrain the environmental conditions during formation to better understand weathering and diagenesis on Mars. This work examines the mineralogy and diagenetic alteration of volcaniclastic paleosols from the Eocene-Oligocene (43-28 Ma) Clarno and John Day Formations in eastern Oregon as a Mars-analog site. Here, paleosols rich in Al phyllosilicates and amorphous colloids overlie paleosols with Fe/Mg smectites that altogether span a sequence of ~ 500 individual profiles across hundreds of meters of vertical stratigraphy. Samples collected from three of these paleosol profiles were analyzed with visible/near-infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and evolved gas analysis (EGA) configured to operate like the SAM-EGA instrument onboard Curiosity Mars Rover. Strongly crystalline Al/Fe dioctahedral phyllosilicates (montmorillonite and nontronite) were the major phases identified in all samples with all methods. Minor phases included the zeolite mineral clinoptilolite, as well as andesine, cristobalite, opal-CT and gypsum. Evolved H<SUB>2</SUB>O was detected in all samples and was consistent with adsorbed water and the dehydroxylation of a dioctahedral phyllosilicate, and differences in H<SUB>2</SUB>O evolutions between montmorillonite and nontronite were readily observable. Detections of hematite and zeolites suggested paleosols were affected by burial reddening and zeolitization, but absence of illite and chlorite suggest that potash metasomatism and other, more severe diagenetic alterations had not occurred. The high clay mineral content of the observed paleosols (up to 95 wt%) may have minimized diagenetic alteration over geological time scales. Martian paleosols rich in Al and Fe smectites may have also resisted severe diagenetic alteration, which is favorable for future in-situ examination. Results from this work can help differentiate paleosols and weathering profiles from other types of sedimentary rocks in the geological record of Mars.',\n",

We describe the helicopter and the associated Technology Demonstration experiment it will conduct, as well as its role in informing future helicopter missions to Mars. This helicopter will demonstrate, for the first time, autonomous controlled flight of an aircraft in the Mars environment, thus opening up an aerial dimension to Mars exploration. The 1.8 kg, 1.2 m diameter helicopter, with twin rotors in a counter-rotating co-axial configuration, will help validate aerodynamics, control, navigation and operations concepts for flight in the thin Martian atmosphere. The rover supports a radio link between the helicopter and mission operators on Earth, and information returned from a planned set of five flights, each lasting up to 90 seconds, will inform the development of new Mars helicopter designs for future missions. Such designs in the 4 kg -30 kg range would have the capability to fly many kilometers daily and carry science payloads of 1 kg -5 kg. Small helicopters can be deployed as scouts for future rovers helping to select interesting science targets, determine optimal rover driving routes, and providing contextual high-vantage imagery. Larger craft can be operated in standalone fashion with a tailored complement of science instruments with direct-to-orbiter communication enabling wide-area operations. Other roles including working cooperatively with a central lander to provide area-wide sampling and science investigations.

       "    'abstract': 'A novel algorithm for rock detection has been developed for effectively utilising Mars rovers, and enabling autonomous selection of target rocks that require close-contact spectroscopic measurements. The algorithm demarcates small rocks in terrain images as seen by cameras on a Mars rover during traverse. This information may be used by the rover for selection of geologically relevant sample rocks, and (in conjunction with a rangefinder) to pick up target samples using a robotic arm for automatic in situ determination of rock composition and mineralogy using, for example, a Raman spectrometer. Determining rock samples within the region that are of specific interest without physically approaching them significantly reduces time, power and risk. Input images in colour are converted to greyscale for intensity analysis. Bilateral filtering is used for texture removal while preserving rock boundaries. Unsharp masking is used for contrast enhance-ment. Sharp contrasts in intensities are detected using Canny edge detection, with thresholds that are calculated from the image obtained after contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalisation of the unsharp masked image. Scale-space representations are then generated by convolving this image with a Gaussian kernel. A scale-invariant blob detector (Laplacian of the Gaussian, LoG) detects blobs independently of their sizes, and therefore requires a multi-scale approach with automatic scale se-lection. The scale-space blob detector consists of convolution of the Canny edge-detected image with a scale-normalised LoG at several scales, and finding the maxima of squared LoG response in scale-space. After the extraction of local intensity extrema, the intensity profiles along rays going out of the local extremum are investigated. An ellipse is fitted to the region determined by significant changes in the intensity profiles. The fitted ellipses are overlaid on the original Mars terrain image for a visual estimation of the rock detection accuracy, and the number of ellipses are counted. Since geometry and illumination have the least effect on small rocks, the proposed algorithm is effective in detecting small rocks (or bigger rocks at larger distances from the camera) that consist of a small fraction of image pixels.

It drew upon the challenges of space exploration to inspire students to consider study and careers in science and engineering. <P />A multi-faceted program, Pathways to Space provided hands-on opportunities for high school and university students to participate in realistic simulations of a robotic Mars exploration mission for astrobiology. Its development was a collaboration between the Australian Centre for Astrobiology (University of New South Wales), the Australian Centre for Field Robotics (University of Sydney), the Powerhouse Museum and industry partner, Cisco. <P />Focused on students in Years 9-10 (15-16 years of age), this program provided them with the opportunity to engage directly with space engineers and astrobiologists, while carrying out a simulated Mars mission using the digital learning facilities available at the Powerhouse Museum. As a part of their program, the students operated robotic mini-rovers in the Powerhouse Museum's “Mars Yard”, a highly accurate simulation of the Martian surface, where university students also carry out the development and testing of experimental Mars roving vehicles. This aspect of the program has brought real science and engineering research into the public space of the museum. <P />As they undertook the education program, the students participated in a research study aimed at understanding the effectiveness of the project in achieving its key objective - encouraging students to consider space related courses and careers. <P />This paper outlines the development and operation of the Pathways to Space project over its 3-year funding period, during which it met and exceeded all the requirements of its ASRP grant. It will look at the goals of the project, the rationale behind the education and science communications research, the challenges of developing such a multi-faceted education project in collaboration with several partners and the results that have already been achieved within the study.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Mars Sample Return mission architecture will utilize three spacecraft to collect, cache, recover, launch, and return to Earth a diversity of regolith and rock samples. However, no comprehensive Mars Microbial Survival (MMS) model currently exists. As an initial effort in building an MMS model, we examined the UV reflectance of 15 spacecraft materials and seven Mars analog soils within the context of the Perseverance mission. Data were used to predict the times required to achieve one lethal dose (syn., Sterility Assurance Level [SAL]; def. as a bioburden reduction of −12 logs). Results suggest that a single SAL dosage of UVC was achieved on exposed surfaces on the upper deck of Perseverance within a few hours to a few sols post-landing at Jezero Crater. The overall average for UVC reflectance from spacecraft materials was approximately 10%. The overall UVC reflectance from Mars analog soils was measured at 1.3%. The Adaptive Caching Assembly (ACA) on Perseverance is located on the forward edge of the underbelly of the spacecraft. Modeling of the accumulated UVC dosage for the ACA yielded a prediction of reaching one SAL for downward facing surfaces at 93 sols that receive \"single-bounce\" UVC photons from the local terrain. The SAL increases to 930 sols if an additional \"bounce\" of the solar UV irradiation is required to reach a partially protected site in the ACA hardware. The current study is the first to report the UVC reflectance from a diversity of spacecraft materials.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The search for preserved evidence of life is the keystone concept for a new generation of Mars rover capable of exploring, sampling, and caching diverse suites of rocks from outcrops. The proposed mission is conceived to address two general objectives: conduct high-priority in situ science and make concrete steps towards the possible future return of samples to Earth. We propose the name Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher (MAX-C) to best reflect the dual purpose of the proposed mission. The scientific objective of the proposed MAX-C would require rover access to a site with high preservation potential for physical and chemical biosignatures in order to evaluate paleo-environmental conditions, characterize the potential for preservation of biosignatures, and access multiple sequences of geological units in a search for evidence of past life and/or prebiotic chemistry. Samples addressing a variety of high-priority scientific objectives should be collected, documented, and packaged in a manner suitable for possible return to Earth by a future mission. Relevant experience from study of ancient terrestrial strata, martian meteorites, and from the Mars Exploration Rovers indicates that the proposed MAX-C’s interpretive capability should include: meter to submillimeter texture (optical imaging), mineral identification, major element content, and organic molecular composition. Analytical data should be obtained by direct investigation of outcrops and should not entail acquisition of rock chips or powders. We propose, therefore, a set of arm-mounted instruments that would be capable of interrogating a relatively smooth, abraded surface by creating co-registered 2-D maps of visual texture, mineralogy and geochemical properties. This approach is judged to have particularly high value for evaluating potential signs of ancient microbial life likely to be manifested at relatively small scale. Scientists could use the 2-D micro-mapping data to select an outstanding set of samples for sample acquisition, encapsulation, and caching. This cache would be left either on the ground or on the rover where it could be recovered by a possible future sample return mission. The proposed MAX-C mission would launch from Earth in May of 2018 and arrive at Mars in January of 2019 during late northern winter. Data from the Mars Exploration Rovers and from orbiting instruments, such as CRISM and HiRISE, continue to reveal sites with phyllosilicates, sulfates, silica, and carbonates which are indicators of aqueous activity and habitability as well as good materials for preservation of physical and chemical biosignatures. Additional information on the seasonality and footprint of methane emissions on Mars is anticipated from the Mars Science Laboratory and proposed future orbiters. In order for the Mars Program to remain highly responsive to these types of discoveries, engineering of MAX-C must integrate micro-mapping and caching functionalities in a flexible design that would minimally encumber landing site competition.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Mars Rover proposed for 2018 to seek signs of life and to cache samples for potential return to Earth Lisa Pratt, David Beatty, Frances Westall, John Parnell, François Poulet, and the MRR-SAG team The search for preserved evidence of life is the keystone concept for a new generation of Mars rover capable of exploring, sampling, and caching diverse suites of rocks from outcrops. The proposed mission is conceived to address two general objectives: conduct high-priority in situ science and make concrete steps towards the possible future return of samples to Earth. We propose the name Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher (MAX-C) to best reflect the dual purpose of the proposed mission. The scientific objective of the proposed MAX-C would require rover access to a site with high preservation potential for physical and chemical biosignatures in order to evaluate paleo-environmental conditions, characterize the potential for preservation of biosignatures, and access multiple sequences of geological units in a search for evidence of past life and/or prebiotic chemistry. Samples addressing a variety of high-priority scientific objectives should be collected, documented, and packaged in a manner suitable for possible return to Earth by a future mission. Relevant experience from study of ancient terrestrial strata, martian meteorites, and from the Mars exploration Rovers indicates that the proposed MAX-C's interpretive capability should include: meter to submillimeter texture (optical imaging), mineral identification, major element content, and organic molecular composition. Analytical data should be obtained by direct investigation of outcrops and should not entail acquisition of rock chips or powders. We propose, therefore, a set of arm-mounted instruments that would be capable of interrogating a relatively smooth, abraded surface by creating co-registered 2-D maps of visual texture, mineralogy and geochemical properties. This approach is judged to have particularly high value for evaluating potential signs of ancient microbial life likely to be manifested at relatively small scale. Scientists could use the 2-D micro-mapping data to select an outstanding set of samples for sample acquisition, encapsulation, and caching. This cache would be left either on the ground or on the rover where it could be recovered by a possible future sample return mission. The proposed MAX-C mission would launch from Earth in May of 2018 and arrive at Mars in January of 2019 during late northern winter. Data from the Mars Exploration Rovers and from orbiting instruments, such as CRISM and HiRISE, continue to reveal sites with phyllosilicates, sulfates, silica, and carbonates which are indicators of aqueous activity and habitability as well as good materials for preservation of physical and chemical biosignatures. Additional information on the seasonality and footprint of methane emissions on Mars is anticipated from the Mars Science Laboratory and proposed future orbiters. In order for the Mars Program to remain highly responsive to these types of discoveries, engineering of MAX-C must integrate micro-mapping and caching functionalities in a flexible design that would minimally encumber landing site competition.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A Mars Rover Sample Return mission was simulated in February, 1999 in the Mojave desert using the Marsokhod rover. The rover payload included a color stereo imager (0.3 mrad/pix resolution, 25 cm stereo baseline on pan and tilt platform at 150 cm height), three sets of navigation cameras (monochrome stereo 1 mrad/pix), a manipulator arm carrying a close-up camera, a Visible/Near Infrared spectrometer (0.35-2.5 micron wavelength range) boresighted with the left color camera. Also included in the simulation were simulated Descent Images, a Thermal Emission Spectrometer (8-14 micron wavelength range) and a simulation of the 2001 Surveyor Mission Robotic Arm Camera. A science team, with no prior knowledge of the test site, participated in the mission simulation conducted at NASA Ames Research Center for 3 weeks. Daily communication cycles transmitted 40 Mbits of data collected by the rover instruments. The rover mission simulated 16 sols on Mars, the rover traversed over 80 m, and acquired 2172 color images, 520 navigation images, 6 arm camera images, 238 NIR spectra, and 18 TIR spectra, for a total data volume of 1024 Mbits. Samples were collected and, subsequent to the field experiment, subjected to petrographic analyses. The science team used the data sets to derive a largely correct interpretation of the geology and mineralogy of the site. The synergism between imaging and spectral data sets in achieving correct and complete interpretations was strongly demonstrated by the experiment. The science team correctly identified a green layer and spectral signature of chlorophyll associated with chasmoendolithic biota in a rock at the field site and designated it for collection. This correct identification of a type of life form that could plausibly be found on Mars demonstrates that rover missions can play a significant role in the search for life on Mars.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The present aerospace engineering and science workforce is ageing. It is not clear that the US education system will produce enough qualified replacements to meet the need in the near future. Unfortunately, by the time many students get to high school, it is often too late to get them pointed toward an engineering or science career. Since some college programs require 6 units of high school mathematics for admission, students need to begin consciously preparing for a science or engineering curriculum as early as 6th or 7th grade. The challenge for educators is to convince elementary school students that science and engineering are both exciting, relevant and accessible career paths. The recent NASA Mars Rover missions capture the imagination of children, as NASA missions have done for decades. The University of Houston is in the process of developing a prototype of a flexible program that offers children an in-depth educational experience culminating in the design and construction of their own model rover. The existing prototype program is called the Mars Rover Model Celebration. It focuses on students, teachers and parents in grades 3-8. Students will design and build a model of a Mars rover to carry out a student selected science mission on the surface of Mars. The model will be a mock-up, constructed at a minimal cost from art supplies. The students will build the models as part of a project on Mars. The students will be given design criteria for a rover and will do basic research on Mars that will determine the objectives and features of their rover. This project may be used either informally as an after school club or youth group activity or formally as part of a class studying general science, earth science, solar system astronomy or robotics, or as a multi-disciplinary unit for a gifted and talented program. The program culminates in a capstone event held at the University of Houston (or other central location in the other communities that will be involved) where the best models from each school or group are brought together for a celebratory showcase exhibit and judging. The project's unique strength lies in engaging students in the process of spacecraft design and interesting them in aerospace engineering careers. The project is aimed at elementary and secondary education. Not only will these students learn about scientific fields relevant to the mission (space science, physics, geology, robotics, and more), they will gain an appreciation for how this knowledge is used to tackle complex problems. The low cost of the event makes it an ideal enrichment vehicle for low income schools. It provides activities that provide professional development to educators, curricular support resources using NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) content, and provides family opportunities for involvement in K-12 student learning.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'ScopePlanetary robotic missions contain vision instruments for various mission-related and science tasks such as 2D and 3D mapping, geologic characterization, atmospheric investigations, or spectroscopy for exobiology. One major application for computer vision is the characterization of scientific context, and the identification of scientific targets of interest (regions, objects, phenomena) for being investigated by other scientific instruments. Due to high variability of appearance of such potentially scientific targets it requires well-adapted yet flexible techniques, one of them being Deep Learning. Machine learning and in particular Deep Learning (DL) is a technique used in computer vision to recognize content in images, categorize it and find objects of specific semantics.In its default workflow, DL requires large sets of training data with known / manually annotated objects, regions or semantic content. Within Mars-DL (Planetary Scientific Target Detection via Deep Learning), training focuses on a simulation approach, by virtual placement of known targets in a true context environment.Mars-DL ApproachThe Mars-DL workflow is depicted in Figure 1, with following details:3D background for the training &amp; validation scenes is taken from 3D reconstructions using true Mars rover imagery (e.g. from the MSL Mastcam instrument). Scientifically interesting objects to be virtually placed in the scene are chosen to be 3D reconstructions of shatter cones (SCs) and/or Meteorites as representative set. The SCs used for 3D reconstruction are from different terrestrial impact structures and cover a wide range of lithologies, including limestone, sandstone, shale and volcanic rocks. Typical features of SCs such as striations and horsetail structure are well developed in all selected specimens and allow a clear identification. The involved stony and iron meteorites are museum quality specimens (NHM Vienna) with fusion crust and/or regmaglypts. A capturing campaign at the NHM Vienna covered more than a dozen SC and meteorite specimen, imaged from various positions under approximate ambient illumination conditions. This was followed by a 3D reconstruction process using photogrammetric techniques (Figure 2) to obtain a seamless watertight high resolution mesh and albedo map for each object, gaining a 3D data base of objects to be randomly placed in the realistic scenes. Simulation of rover imagery for training is based on PRo3D, a viewer for the interactive exploration and geologic analysis of high-resolution planetary surface reconstructions [1]. It was adapted to efficiently render large amounts of images in batch mode controlled by a JSON file. SCs are automatically positioned on a chosen surface region with a Halton sequence, whereby collisions are avoided. The SCs are color adjusted to perfectly blend into the scene and in a future version will also receive and cast shadows. Special GPU shaders provide additional types of training images such as masks and depth maps. A typical rendering data set to be used for training is depicted in Figure 4. A random pose generator selects representative yet random positions and fields-of-view for the training images. Unsupervised generative-adversarial neural image-to-image translation techniques (GAN; [2]) are then applied on the background of the generated images, thus producing realistic landscapes drawn from the domain of actual Mars rover datasets while preserving the integrity of the high-resolution shatter cone models. The candidate meta-architectures for the machine learning approach are Mask R-CNN (instance segmentation) and Faster R-CNN (object detection), as these currently belong to the best performing architectures for these tasks. These meta-architectures can be configured with different backbone networks (e.g. ResNet-50, Darknet-53), which provide a tradeoff between network size and convergence rate. A remaining unused training set will be used for evaluation. Summary and OutlookSo far science autonomy has been addressed only recently with increased mobility on planetary surfaces and the upcoming need for planetary rovers to react autonomously to given science opportunities, well in view of limited data exchange resources and tight operations cycles.An Austrian Consortium in the so-called \"Mars-DL\" project is targeting the adaptation and test of simulation and deep learning mechanisms for autonomous detection of scientific targets of interest during robotic planetary surface missions.For past and present missions the project will help explore &amp; exploit further existing millions of planetary surface images that still hide undetected science opportunities.The exploratory project will assess the feasibility of machine-learning based support during and after missions by automatic search on planetary surface imagery to raise science gain, meet serendipitous opportunities and speed up the tactical and strategic decision making during mission planning. An automatic \"Science Target Consultant\" (STC) is realized in prototype form, which, as a test version, can be plugged in to ExoMars operations once the mission has landed.In its remaining runtime until end of 2020, Mars-DL training and validation will explore the possibility to search scientifically interesting targets across different sensors, investigate the usage of different cues such as 2D (multispectral / monochrome) and 3D, as well as spatial relationships between image data and regions thereon.During mission operations of forthcoming missions (Mars 2020, and ExoMars &amp; Sample Fetch Rover in particular) the STC can help avoid the missing of opportunities that may occur due to tactical time constraints preventing in-depth check of image material.AcknowledgmentsThis abstract presents the results of the project Mars-DL, which received funding from the Austrian Space Applications Programme (ASAP14) financed by BMVIT, Project Nr. 873683, and project partners JOANNEUM RESEARCH, VRVis, SLR Engineering, and the National History Museum Vienna.References[1] Barnes R., Sanjeev G., Traxler C., Hesina G., Ortner T., Paar G., Huber B., Juhart K., Fritz L., Nauschnegg B., Muller J.P., Tao Y. and Bauer A.

An engineering approach for the analysis of various types of vehicles and trajectories was taken, rather than performing a benchmark computation for a specific point at a selected time point in a trajectory. The radiation into Mars using the Mars Rover Sample Return (MRSR) 2-ft nose radius bionic remains a small contributor of heating for 6 to 10 km/sec; however, at 12 km/sec it becomes comparable with the convection. For earth aerocapture, returning from Mars, peak radiation for the MRSR SRC is only 25 percent of the peak convection for the 12-km/sec trajectory. However, when large vehicles are considered with this trajectory, peak radiation can become 2 to 4 times higher than the peak convection.

       "    'abstract': \"Intense interest in the characteristics of a methane source on Mars has been spurred by recent observations of a plume structure. The current NASA Mars Science Laboratory and future landers and orbiters will be tasked with understanding the sources of methane. The Canadian Space Agency's Mars Methane Analogue Mission, involving a simulated Mars micro-rover field campaign, was recently able to detect and measure the isotopic composition of methane seeping from boreholes in a serpentine mine in Québec. We aim to determine spatial limits for detecting such a point source above the terrestrial background concentration of methane using gradient transport models. We estimate the source strength to be on the order of 5.3 × <SUP>-10</SUP> kg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and find that this produces detectable enhancements at distances less than 11.6 m from the source if there is no wind. These same models are applied to the Mars surface environment to determine whether an instrument on a rover would be capable of detecting a methane point source when not directly downwind of it. The estimated source strengths on Mars are much greater than at Jeffrey Mine and we find that these would be detectable at distances less than 30 m from the plume axis, which lies along the direction of advective transport. Much of the work done on modelling the Martian atmosphere uses large-scale general circulation models and this work examines the behaviour of methane plumes at very local scales.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Phosphorus and potassium are a fluid-mobile element pair that constrains fluid conditions on the martian surface. The geochemical conditions under which P and K were incorporated into primary phases, released via alteration into fluids, and precipitated into secondary phases are recorded in the sedimentary units of the Murray fm. in Gale crater. The two elements are detectable (&gt;300 ppm) by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) on the Mars rover Curiosity, and enrichments have been discovered in Gale crater. Volcanics from Maunakea and Kohala on Hawai'i are compositionally analogous to Gale crater, and the mobility of P and K during alteration of Hawaiian lava and tephra may indicate similar processes on Mars. Here, we report results for P<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> and K<SUB>2</SUB>O in Gale crater (APXS) and Hawaiian volcanics (XRF) and discuss possible analogue geochemical processes that may have acted on sediments in Gale crater. <P />The Murray fm. has elevated P\\xad<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> (0.9 - 1.3 wt%) relative to the average martian crust (0.9 wt%). Diagenetic features (n ~15) with P<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> enrichments (1.5 - 7.5 wt%) are evidence that phosphate was mobile in-situ after the sediment was deposited. In Murray bedrock, K<SUB>2</SUB>O is consistently elevated (0.76 ± 0.12 wt%) relative to soil (0.47 ± 0.07 wt%). In situ mobility is indicated by two diagenetic features with high K<SUB>2</SUB>O (1.9 wt% - 2.3 wt%) that have K:Fe:S approximating jarosite. <P />The bulk chemical and mineralogical composition (XRF and XRD) of altered Maunakea and Kohala samples show that, after emplacement, P and K mobility is dependent on the alteration regime. In a circumneutral pedogenic regime, the primary apatite has low solubility and P is retained in weathered residue, whereas K is mobilized and leached out of the rock. In contrast, Maunakea tephra altered in an acid-sulfate regime retains both K and P in altered residue, where K occurs in jarosite and P likely occurs in amorphous Fe-, Al-phosphates. <P />As observed in the Hawaiian samples, the in situ mobility of both P and K in the Murray fm. is consistent with a fluid pH &lt; 6. The detection of jarosite by the CheMin XRD indicates a lower pH &lt; 4.5. Under these conditions, amorphous Fe-, Al-phosphates are probable. These observations suggest that acidic fluids interacted with Gale crater sediment after it was deposited and may have altered the materials.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"A full dust devil ``season'' was observed from Spirit from 10 March 2005 (sol 421, first active dust devil observed) to 12 December 2005 (sol 691, last dust devil seen); this corresponds to the period L<SUB>s</SUB> 173.2° to 339.5°, or the southern spring and summer on Mars. Thermal Emission Spectrometer data suggest a correlation between high surface temperatures and a positive thermal gradient with active dust devils in Gusev and that Spirit landed in the waning stages of a dust devil season as temperatures decreased. 533 active dust devils were observed, enabling new characterizations; they ranged in diameter from 2 to 276 m, with most in the range of 10-20 m in diameter, and occurred from about 0930 to 1630 hours local true solar time (with the maximum forming around 1300 hours) and a peak occurrence in southern late spring (L<SUB>s</SUB> ~ 250°). Horizontal speeds of the dust devils ranged from &lt;1 to 21 m/s, while vertical wind speeds within the dust devils ranged from 0.2 to 8.8 m/s. These data, when combined with estimates of the dust content within the dust devils, yield dust fluxes of 3.95 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP> to 4.59<SUP>-4</SUP> kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>/s. Analysis of the dust devil frequency distribution over the inferred dust devil zone within Gusev crater yields ~50 active dust devils/km<SUP>2</SUP>/sol, suggesting a dust loading into the atmosphere of ~19 kg/km<SUP>2</SUP>/sol. This value is less than one tenth the estimates by Cantor et al. (2001) for regional dust storms on Mars.\",\n",

In this work, we use normalizing flows on structured spectral latent spaces to estimate such densities, enabling downstream inference tasks. In addition, we evaluate a method for uncertainty quantification when predicting unobserved state vectors associated with each spectrum. We demonstrate the capability of this approach on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy data collected by the ChemCam instrument on the Mars rover Curiosity. Using our approach, we are able to generate realistic spectral samples and to accurately predict state vectors with associated well-calibrated uncertainties.

       "    'abstract': \"The ripple field known as ``El Dorado'' was a unique stop on Spirit's traverse where dust-raising, active mafic sand ripples and larger inactive coarse-grained ripples interact, illuminating several long-standing issues of Martian dust mobility, sand mobility, and the origin of transverse aeolian ridges. Strong regional wind events endured by Spirit caused perceptible migration of ripple crests in deposits SSE of El Dorado, erasure of tracks in sandy areas, and changes to dust mantling the site. Localized thermal vortices swept across El Dorado, leaving paths of reduced dust but without perceptibly damaging nearly cohesionless sandy ripple crests. From orbit, winds responsible for frequently raising clay-sized dust into the atmosphere do not seem to significantly affect dunes composed of (more easily entrained) sand-sized particles, a long-standing paradox. This disparity between dust mobilization and sand mobilization on Mars is due largely to two factors: (1) dust occurs on the surface as fragile, low-density, sand-sized aggregates that are easily entrained and disrupted, compared with clay-sized air fall particles; and (2) induration of regolith is pervasive. Light-toned bed forms investigated at Gusev are coarse-grained ripples, an interpretation we propose for many of the smallest linear, light-toned bed forms of uncertain origin seen in high-resolution orbital images across Mars. On Earth, wind can organize bimodal or poorly sorted loose sediment into coarse-grained ripples. Coarse-grained ripples could be relatively common on Mars because development of durable, well-sorted sediments analogous to terrestrial aeolian quartz sand deposits is restricted by the lack of free quartz and limited hydraulic sediment processing.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"On multiple solar system missions, radar instruments have been used to probe subsurface geomorphology and to infer chemical composition based on the dielectric signature derived from the reflected signal. One important planetary application is the identification of subsurface water ice at Mars. Low frequency, 15 MHz to 25 MHz, instruments like SHARAD have been used from Mars orbit to investigate subsurface features from 10's to 1000's of meters below the surface of Mars with a vertical resolution of 15m and a horizontal resolution of 300 to 3000 meters. SHARAD has been able to identify vast layers of CO2 and water ice. The ground-penetrating RIMFAX instrument that will ride on the back of the Mars 2020 rover will operate over the 150 MHz to 1200 MHz band and penetrate to a depth of 10 meters with a vertical resolution of 15 to 30 cm. RIMFAX will be able to identify near surface water ice if it exists below the travel path of the Mars 2020 rover. Identification of near surface water ice has science application to current and past Mars hydrologic processes and to the potential for finding remnants of past Mars biologic activity. Identification of near surface water ice also has application to future human missions that would benefit from access to a Mars local water source. Recently, JPL investigators have been pursuing a secondary use of telecom signals to capture bistatic radar signatures from subsurface areas surrounding the rover but away from its travel path. A particularly promising potential source would be the telecom signal from a proposed Mars Helicopter back to the Mars 2020 rover. The Mars 2020 rover will be equipped with up to three telecom subsystems. The Rover Relay telecom subsystem operates at UHF receiving at 435 MHz frequency. Anticipating opportunistic collection of near-surface bistatic radar signatures from telecom signals received at the rover, it is valuable to understand the dielectric properties of the Martian soil in each of these three possible frequency bands. In their 2004 paper, Williams and Greely reported on measurements of the dielectric and attenuation properties of Mars soil analogs made in the band of 200 MHz to 1300 MHz. Their results apply directly to the Mars rover telecom links at 435 MHz and 915 MHz. This paper reports on dielectric measurements made on the same Mars soil analogs over the band of 7 GHz to 40 GHz.\",\n",

The spacecraft design is based on the Mars Pathfinder configuration for cruise and entry, descent, and landing. Each of the identical rovers is equipped with a science payload of two remote-sensing instruments that will view the surrounding terrain from the top of a mast, a robotic arm that can place three instruments and a rock abrasion tool on selected rock and soil samples, and several onboard magnets and calibration targets. Engineering sensors and components useful for science investigations include stereo navigation cameras, stereo hazard cameras in front and rear, wheel motors, wheel motor current and voltage, the wheels themselves for digging, gyros, accelerometers, and reference solar cell readings. Mission operations will allow commanding of the rover each Martian day, or sol, on the basis of the previous sol's data. Over a 90-sol mission lifetime, the rovers are expected to drive hundreds of meters while carrying out field geology investigations, exploration, and atmospheric characterization.

Initially, the IR camera was integrated with the Satellite Test Assistant Robot (STAR) system which demonstrated successful operation in late 1994. During this initial demonstration, the IR camera experienced 24 hours of a hard vacuum with simulated space temperatures between minus 190 degrees Celsius to plus 25 degrees Celsius. Subsequently, the IR camera was subjected to 12 hours of a simulated space and 72 hours of a simulated Martian environment during the Mars Rover test. Equipped only with thermostatically controlled heaters to prevent undercooling, the IR camera operated continuously during these periods and provided numerous images of the simulator interior, a reference target, and the Mars Rover. The reference target consisted of nine samples of different materials used in typical aerospace thermal designs. The emittance range covered 0.02 to 0.90. The target temperature range was varied from minus 80 degrees Celsius to 55 degrees Celsius. The IR camera was reliable and provided quality images throughout this range but measurement accuracy was a strong function of target temperature and emittance. Best results for high emittance targets were within 12 degrees Celsius at minus 80 degrees Celsius to within 1 degree Celsius at plus 55 degrees Celsius.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) is an energetic particle detector designed to measure a broad spectrum of energetic particle radiation. It will make the first-ever direct radiation measurements on the surface of Mars, detecting galactic cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, secondary neutrons, and other secondary particles created both in the atmosphere and in the Martian regolith. The radiation environment on Mars, both past and present, may have implications for habitability and the ability to sustain life. Radiation exposure is also a major concern for future human missions. The RAD instrument combines charged- and neutral-particle detection capability over a wide dynamic range in a compact, low-mass, low-power instrument. These capabilities are required in order to measure all the important components of the radiation environment. RAD consists of the RAD Sensor Head (RSH) and the RAD Electronics Box (REB) integrated together in a small, compact volume. The RSH contains a solid-state detector telescope with three silicon PIN diodes for charged particle detection, a thallium doped Cesium Iodide scintillator, plastic scintillators for neutron detection and anti-coincidence shielding, and the front-end electronics. The REB contains three circuit boards, one with a novel mixed-signal ASIC for processing analog signals and an associated control FPGA, another with a second FPGA to communicate with the rover and perform onboard analysis of science data, and a third board with power supplies and power cycling or \"sleep\"-control electronics. The latter enables autonomous operation, independent of commands from the rover. RAD is a highly capable and highly configurable instrument that paves the way for future compact energetic particle detectors in space.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Gusev crater was selected as the landing site for the Spirit rover because of the possibility that it once held a lake. Thus one of the rover's tasks was to search for evidence of lake sediments. However, the plains at the landing site were found to be covered by a regolith composed of olivine-rich basaltic rock and windblown `global' dust. The analyses of three rock interiors exposed by the rock abrasion tool showed that they are similar to one another, consistent with having originated from a common lava flow. Here we report the investigation of soils, rock coatings and rock interiors by the Spirit rover from sol (martian day) 1 to sol 156, from its landing site to the base of the Columbia hills. The physical and chemical characteristics of the materials analysed provide evidence for limited but unequivocal interaction between water and the volcanic rocks of the Gusev plains. This evidence includes the softness of rock interiors that contain anomalously high concentrations of sulphur, chlorine and bromine relative to terrestrial basalts and martian meteorites; sulphur, chlorine and ferric iron enrichments in multilayer coatings on the light-toned rock Mazatzal; high bromine concentration in filled vugs and veins within the plains basalts; positive correlations between magnesium, sulphur and other salt components in trench soils; and decoupling of sulphur, chlorine and bromine concentrations in trench soils compared to Gusev surface soils, indicating chemical mobility and separation.\",\n",

Well-known initiative of President of the USA, recent progress of American and European scientists and engineers in implementation of “Mars Odyssey” and “Mars-Express” projects and Russian proposals on cooperation and participation in “Phobos Sample Return” mission declare every intention to join efforts in the ambitious Martian Program realization. The final goal of the program for nearly 15 20 years is landing of a man on the Martian surface. Before this event happens another critical stage will be Martian soil sample return. Within the next 10 years, apparently, a major task will be scale research by means of various types of technical facilities. A crucial issue for this research will be creation of research station network which would allow collecting information about planetary conditions at far-remote points. By this time within the frame of “Phobos Sample Return Program” to be launched in 2009 it is planned to deliver some meteorological mini-landers developed by the Russian and Finnish specialists on the Martian surface. From this point view it is also interesting to use balloons capable to cover considerable distance. Such proposals have been made by Russian side for “Scout” mission. European “Aurora” program also anticipates application of wide range of technical means to explore the Martian atmosphere and surface including inflatable devices. Thus, for the International Mars Exploration Program, it seems to be very prospective to use apart from launch vehicles, upper stages etc. such technical means as mini-stations, Mars rovers, penetrators, balloons, etc.',\n",

In order to better communicate this period to our target audiences, NASA’s Planetary Science Division created the Year of the Solar System (YSS) initiative. YSS is being designed to raise awareness, build excitement and make connections with educators, students and the American public about planetary science events and discoveries. Over the next Martian year, with our international partners we will encounter two comets; orbit spacecraft around Venus, Mercury and Vesta; continue to explore Mars with rovers; and launch robotic explorers to Jupiter, Earth’s moon, and Mars. For the first time ever NASA will launch three planetary missions within four months of each other! With the successful accomplishment of these mission events will come a series of fabulous scientific discoveries. We must take advantage of this unique opportunity to get the word out about the scientific revolution occurring in planetary science. This presentation will also discuss the importance of providing relatable material through Earth analogs, comparative visuals, interactive web-based tools and other ideas to communicate, why people should care about these exciting discoveries to come.',\n",

Because of the unknowns associated with the Mars environment, the use of adaptive control techniques is critical to the successful outcome. This paper will describe work done over several years at assessing the performance of a continuous roll control technique coupled with a closed loop predictor corrector guidance system. The implementation of this system is called CLAAS (Closed Loop AeroAssist Simulation). This system has been tested against a variety of dispersions including a variety of atmospheric models, atmospheric shear waves, vehicle variations, and navigation errors. Results will be shown for a two mission applications, a representative manned Mars vehicle and an unmanned Mars Rover Sample Return (MRSR) system. Finally, a few observations on technical challenges for aerobraking a Mars vehicle are included in the conclusions.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The work described in this paper was done under ESA and Thales Alenia Space contract in the frame of the Analysis of Surface Architecture for European Space Exploration -Element Design. Future manned space missions to the Moon or to Mars will require a vehicle for transporting astronauts in a controlled and protected environment and in relative comfort during surface traverses of these planetary bodies. The vehicle that will be needed is a pressurized rover which serves the astronauts as a habitat, a refuge and a research laboratory/workshop. A number of basic issues influencing the design of such a rover, e.g. habitability, human-machine interfaces, safety, dust mitigation, interplanetary contamination and radiation protection, have been analysed in detail. The results of these analyses were subsequently used in an investigation of various designs for a rover suitable for surface exploration, from which a single concept was developed that satisfied scientific requirements as well as environmental requirements encoun-tered during surface exploration of the Moon and Mars. This concept was named in memory of the late Sir Arthur C. Clark RAMA (Rover for Advanced Mission Applications, Rover for Advanced Moon Applications, Rover for Advanced Mars Applications) The concept design of the pressurized rover meets the scientific and operational requirements defined during the course of the Surface Architecture Study. It is designed for surface missions with a crew of two or three lasting up to approximately 40 days, its source of energy, a liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen fuel cell, allowing it to be driven and operated during the day as well as the night. Guidance, navigation and obstacle avoidance systems are foreseen as standard equipment to allow it to travel safely over rough terrain at all times of the day. The rover allows extra-vehicular activity and a remote manipulator is provided to recover surface samples, to deploy surface instruments and equipment and, in general, to assist the astronauts' field activities wherever and whenever needed. The vehicle has also been designed to have a very high degree of manoeuvrability. In addition, RAMA may be operated and replenished from a fixed site base or co-operate with other rovers of the same type to provide a mobile base. The rover in all cases will be refuelled using the products supplied by an in-situ resources facility. Transportation and surface exploration requirements defined the size and mass of the rover. RAMA has a launch mass of approximately 7000 kg, a dry mass of about 6200 kg and surface mission masses of between 7800 and 8300 kg. The rover can be launched by a future heavy lift launcher similar to the American ARES V concept. The factor most affecting the mass of the rover, other than the quantities of fuel cell reactants and crew consumables, is the amount of radiation shielding integrated in the design of the rover's pressurized shell. The factor most influencing the rover's external and internal configuration is the launcher's payload envelope and the need for the rover's centre-of-mass to be aligned with or close to the launcher's longitudinal axis. Technologies needed to support the design of the rover and its subsystems were investigated to identify the issues concerned with a possible implementation.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"``Spirit'' at the Gusev crater near the dichotomy boundary sent a panoramic view, an image of the near ground and a very close view of a small spot analyzed by X-ray. The first impression of chaotic disposition of big and small rocks and sandy fragments is wrong. All scales images display striations in 4 directions probably due to intersecting undulations, besides, rock fragments are rather evenly distributed. This is not of surprise because many MOLA images show very regular patterns described earlier for intersecting wave processes on planetary surfaces [1]. The middle scale image shows angular rock fragments of various sizes protruding soil. There is an impression that the protruding blocks represent uplifted parts of a wave-woven surface of volcanic infilling , subsided parts being covered with sandy soil mainly of eolian origin. Such an interpretation is supported by the THEMIS image (released 23 Sept., 2003 in Internet) of a 22 km-diameter crater on Sirenum Fossae where wave structurized (volcanic?) material is gradually covered by eolian sediments leaving protruding high standing blocks (antinodes). The soil X-ray analysis shows high Si an Fe, some Al, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Cl, S, minor Cu, Ni, Zn that should be expected for a mixed material at low/highland contact contaminated by an eolian stuff. ``Opportunity'' is the first highland landing and in this is its highest importance. It seems that long awaited light (in color and density) rock type without Fe [2, 3 &amp; others] is in front of us. The leveled out white outcrops probably represent this kind of rocks (albitites, syenites). Eleveted K, Na, CL, S, Si and H20 (!) detected by gamma and neutron spectra can be explained by sodalite (hydrosodalite) and cancrinite group minerals present in nepheline syenites -- albitites and always accompanied by zeolites containing water. The high chemical dichotomy (and mantle fractionation) between lowlands and highlands is an important part of the wave planetology (Theorem 4 [3]). References: [1] Kochemasov G.G.

       "    'abstract': 'Aeolian processes are believed to play a major role in the landscape evolution of Mars. Investigations on Martian aeolian landforms such as ripples, transverse aeolian ridges (TARs), and dunes, and aeolian sediment flux measurements are important to enhance our understanding of past and present wind regimes, the ongoing dust cycle, landscape evolution, and geochemistry. These aeolian bedforms are often comprised of loose sand and sharply undulating topography and thus pose a threat to mobility and maneuvers of Mars rovers. Here we present a first-hand account of the distribution, morphologies, and morphometrics of TARs in Oxia Planum, the recently selected ExoMars 2020 Rover landing site. The gridded mapping was performed for contiguous stretches of TARs within all the landing ellipses using 57 sub-meter high resolution imaging science experiment (HiRISE) scenes. We also provide the morphological descriptions for all types of TARs present within the landing ellipses. We use HiRISE digital terrain models (DTMs) along with the images to derive morphometric information for TARs in Oxia Planum. In general, the average areal TAR coverage was found to be 5.4% (±4.9% standard deviation), increasing from west to east within the landing ellipses. We report the average TAR morphometrics in the form of crest–ridge width (131.1 ± 106.2 m), down-wind TAR length (17.6 ± 10.1 m), wavelength (37.3 ± 11.6 m), plan view aspect ratio (7.1 ± 2.3), inter-bedform spacing (2.1 ± 1.1), slope (10.6° ± 6.1°), predominant orientations (NE-SW and E-W), and height (1.2 ± 0.8 m). While simple TARs are predominant, we report other TAR morphologies such as forked TAR, wavy TAR with associated smaller secondary ripples, barchan-like TAR, networked TAR, and mini-TARs from the region. Our results can help in planning the rover traverses in terms of both safe passage and scientific returns favoring aeolian research, particularly improving our understanding of TARs.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Mars rover missions are currently exploring ancient and modern sedimentary environments in Gale and Jezero craters. Observations of sedimentary deposits and their composition suggest that both craters have been geologically dynamic regions that may have received sediment input from a combination of impact, lacustrine, fluvial, aeolian, volcanic, and glacial environments. However, linking the composition observed at the surface to the provenance and specific transport history of these sedimentary deposits is challenging. <P />This work aims to understand the effects of physical sorting and chemical alteration on compositional variability in a fluvio-aeolian system within a Mars-analog glaciovolcanic environment in Iceland. We find that (1) alteration during transport in this cold environment is limited and (2) compositional trends occur primarily due to size- and density-dependent sorting. <P />We examine two source-to-sink transects. The first fluvial system sediments are sourced from glacial and intraglacial volcanic deposits, with crystalline lava flows and palagonite, over a 10 km distance. The second fluvial system sediments are derived from glaciovolcanic sediments that contain a mixture of crystalline mafic and sand-size glassy hyaloclastite grains over 150 km. Visible to near infrared (350-2500 nm) reflectance spectra were acquired from sediment samples dry-sieved into eight grain-size separates from &lt;38 µm and &gt;4 mm to analyze compositional trends with grain size downstream and will be compared with bulk results from XRD and thermal-infrared models. <P />Source sediments in the first system have strong compositional differences with grain size, but the short 10 km transect was not sufficient to change the initial compositional distribution. In the second system, spectral signatures of glass-dominated sands near the source disappear with distance over the 155 km transect. On Mars, glass is a component in aeolian sediments but has not been identified as an obvious component of fluvial sediments. These analyses suggest that if glaciovolcanism was common on Mars, sediments transported by fluvial and aeolian processes in small watersheds should produce poorly sorted deposits with compositional variability primarily at the grain scale and the presence of glass can be used to diagnose proximity to the source.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) and Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover (MSL) are proxies for field geologists on Mars, taking high resolution imagery of rock formations and landscapes which is analysed in detail on Earth. Panoramic digital cameras (PanCam on MER and MastCam on MSL) are used for characterising the geology of rock outcrops along rover traverses. A key focus is on sedimentary rocks that have the potential to contain evidence for ancient life on Mars. Clues to determine ancient sedimentary environments are preserved in layer geometries, sedimentary structures and grain size distribution. The panoramic camera systems take stereo images which are co-registered to create 3D point clouds of rock outcrops to be quantitatively analysed much like geologists would do on Earth. The EU FP7 PRoViDE project is compiling all Mars rover vision data into a database accessible through a web-GIS (PRoGIS) and 3D viewer (PRo3D). Stereo-imagery selected in PRoGIS can be rendered in PRo3D, enabling the user to zoom, rotate and translate the 3D outcrop model. Interpretations can be digitised directly onto the 3D surface, and simple measurements can be taken of the dimensions of the outcrop and sedimentary features. Dip and strike is calculated within PRo3D from mapped bedding contacts and fracture traces. Results from multiple outcrops can be integrated in PRoGIS to gain a detailed understanding of the geological features within an area. These tools have been tested on three case studies; Victoria Crater, Yellowknife Bay and Shaler. Victoria Crater, in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars, was visited by the MER-B Opportunity Rover. Erosional widening of the crater produced &lt;15 m high outcrops which expose ancient Martian eolian bedforms. Yellowknife Bay and Shaler were visited in the early stages of the MSL mission, and provide excellent opportunities to characterise Martian fluvio-lacustrine sedimentary features. Development of these tools is crucial to exploitation of vision data from future missions, such as the 2018 ExoMars Rover and the NASA 2020 mission. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n° 312377 PRoViDE.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Active neutron measurements by DAN [1] are performing onboard the Curiosity Rover [2]. During active measurements, the Pulsing Neutron Generator of DAN is producing pulses of 14 MeV neutrons, which diffuse in a tested substance during a time as large as several milliseconds. Before escaping out from the martian surface, they make a large number of collisions with nuclei of the atoms of the substance encountered. This diffusion of neutrons results in a moderation of the neutron\\'s energy, since particles lose a fraction of energy in each collision. When a substance contains atoms of hydrogen, neutrons lose about half of their energy at each collision with them. The method of neutron data deconvolution is based on the direct comparison between the measured die-away time profiles of the epithermal and thermal neutrons in the testing spot with the corresponding time profiles predicted by the numerical simulations (see [1]). For the preliminary analysis of DAN data, we used the standard composition of the soil (see [3]). The simplest model of regolith was one with the same content of hydrogen over each individual tested spot, both in length and in depth (homogeneous model). It has only one fitting parameter, the Water Equivalent Hydrogen (WEH) measured in wt% of water in the soil. It was found that data for only one measurement in the spot of Hottah agrees with this model: the WEH corresponds to about 2 wt% at this stop. The 2-layer model is the next after the homogeneous model in level of complexity: it corresponds to 2 layers with different contents of hydrogen. There are three free parameters of this model: WEH in the top layer, thickness of the top layer and WEH in the bottom layer below the top one. The content of hydrogen in the top layer was found to be practically the same at stops, the value of water in the uplayer was about 1.0 - 1.5 % WEH. The other two parameters of 2-layer model were found to vary from one testing spot to another. For the distance interval of [0 - 100 m] and for the interval of [220 - 500 m] the bottom layer is found to have hydrogen with a vari-able content 2 - 6 wt% WEH at the depth of about 10 - 30 cm. For the distance interval of [100 - 220] hydrogen content is more variable with limits of 4 - 8 wt% WEH, the depth is also somewhat larger, 20 - 40 cm. References: [1] Mitrofanov I.G. et al.

The program is called the Mars Rover Model Celebration (MRC). It focuses on students, teachers and parents in grades 3-8. Students design and build a model of a Mars rover to carry out a student selected science mission on the surface of Mars. A total of 65 Mars Rover teachers from the 2012-2013 cohort were invited to complete the Mars Rover Teacher Evaluation Survey. The survey was administered online and could be taken at the convenience of the participant. In total, 29 teachers participated in the survey. Teachers were asked to rate their current level of confidence in their ability to teach specific topics within the Earth and Life Science realms, as well as their confidence in their ability to implement teaching strategies with their students. In addition, they were asked to rate the degree to which they felt their confidence increased in the past year as a result of their participation in the MRC program. The majority of teachers (81-90%) felt somewhat to very confident in their ability to effectively teach concepts related to earth and life sciences to their students. In addition, many of the teachers felt that their confidence in teaching these concepts increased somewhat to quite a bit as a result of their participation in the MRC program (54-88%). The most striking increase in this area was the reported 48% of teachers who felt their confidence in teaching 'Earth and the solar system and universe' increased 'Quite a bit' as a result of their participation in the MRC program. The vast majority of teachers (86-100%) felt somewhat to very confident in their ability to effectively implement all of the listed teaching strategies. In addition, the vast majority reported believing that their confidence increased somewhat to quite a bit as a result of their participation in the MRC program (81-96%). The most striking increases were the percentage of teachers who felt their confidence increased 'Quite a bit' as a result of their participation in the MRC program in the following areas: 'Getting students interested in and curious about science' (63%); 'Teaching science as a co-inquirer with students' (56%); and 'Continually find better ways to teach science' (59%). The areas where teachers reported the least amount of increase were those related to: Fostering student reading comprehension skills during science instruction and learning and integrating reading language arts into my science teaching. This outcome, however, is not surprising as many teachers reported not implementing the language arts, comprehension and vocabulary aspects of the program. The program training for last year did not explicitly cover the language arts components in detail or with support.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has been extensively utilized in deep-space exploration. However, GPR modeling commonly employs simplified antenna models and carrier-free impulse signals, resulting in reduced accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we addressed these limitations by combining a tilted monopole antenna and linear frequency modulation continuous wave (LFMCW) to simulate real conditions. Additionally, a radiation-pattern-compensation back-propagation (RPC-BP) algorithm was developed to improve the illumination of the right-inclined structure. We first introduced the LFMCW used by the Mars Rover Penetrating Radar (RoPeR) onboard the Zhurong rover, where frequencies range from 15 to 95 MHz. Although the LFMCW signal improves radiation efficiency, it increases data processing complexity. Then, the radiation patterns and response of the tilted monopole antenna were analyzed, where the radiated signal amplitude varies with frequency. Finally, a series of numerical and laboratory experiments were conducted to interpret the real RoPeR data. The results indicate that hyperbolic echoes tilt in the opposite direction of the survey direction. This study demonstrates that forward modeling considering real transmit signals and complex antenna models can improve modeling accuracy and prevent misleading interpretations on deep-space exploration missions. Moreover, the migration process can improve imaging quality by considering radiation pattern compensation.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Opportunity has been traversing the plains of Meridiani since January 25, 2004, acquiring remote sensing and in-situ observations of soils, cobbles, and bedrock, together with atmospheric observations. This paper provides an overview of discoveries between sols 511 (July 1, 2005) and 2300 (July 13, 2010), complementing a similar paper by Squyres et al., [2006] covering results from the initial phase of the mission. Use of the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer to measure atmospheric argon shows the importance of the southern seasonal ice cap in controlling atmospheric dynamics, with inter-annual variations evident over the three Mars years of observations. The plains are partially covered by aeolian ripples produced by easterly winds during a previous epoch with enhanced Hadley cell circulation. During the current climatic regime, fine-grained particles continue to be reworked locally and trapped. Ripple surfaces are composed of basaltic sand mixed with varying amounts of dust and hematitic concretions. Cobbles examined by Opportunity include iron and stony iron meteorites and both sedimentary and basaltic impact ejecta. Hematite-rich deposits in fractures within ejecta from Concepcion crater, together with iron oxide deposits on meteorites, imply on-going aqueous alteration at low rates. Measurements of sulfate-rich rock strata within the walls of Erebus and Victoria craters provide compelling evidence of sand deposition by wind, with local reworking within ephemeral lakes. We continue to search for the lacustrine facies that would confirm or refute the hypothesis that the sands were produced in an acid-sulfate evaporitic environment. Rocks examined in the upper walls of Victoria and Endurance craters also show enrichment of Cl and a decrease in Mg and S with increasing depth. This pattern implies that regional-scale aqueous alteration took place before formation of these craters. Opportunity has been traversing toward the rim of the 20 km wide Endeavour crater. This crater predates the formation of the layered sedimentary rocks examined by Opportunity, and analysis of CRISM data shows that clay minerals are exposed on its rim. CRISM data also indicate the presence of hydrated sulfate minerals in sedimentary rocks adjacent to the rim, unlike the anhydrous surfaces of outcrops observed thus far by Opportunity. Thus, with continuing mechanical health, Opportunity will reach a terrain markedly different from anything examined to date.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Meteorites that fall to Earth quickly become contaminated with terrestrial microorganisms. These meteorites are out of chemical equilibrium in the environments where they fall, and equilibration promotes formation of low-temperature alteration minerals that can entomb contaminant microorganisms and thus preserve them as microfossils. Given the well-understood chemistry of meteorites and their recent discovery on Mars by rovers, a similarly weathered meteorite on Mars could preserve organic and fossil evidence of a putative past biosphere at the martian surface. Here, we used several techniques to assess the potential of alteration minerals to preserve microfossils and biogenic organics in terrestrially weathered ordinary chondrites from the Nullarbor Plain, Australia. We used acid etching of ordinary chondrites to reveal entombed fungal hyphae, modern biofilms, and diatoms within alteration minerals. We employed synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy of alteration mineral veins to map the distribution of redox-sensitive elements of relevance to chemolithotrophic organisms, such as Mn-cycling bacteria. We assessed the biogenicity of fungal hyphae within alteration veins using a combination of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, which showed that alteration minerals sequester and preserve organic molecules at various levels of decomposition. Our combined analyses results show that fossil microorganisms and the organic molecules they produce are preserved within calcite-gypsum admixtures in meteorites. Furthermore, the distributions of redox-sensitive elements (e.g., Mn) within alteration minerals are localized, which qualitatively suggests that climatically or microbially facilitated element mobilization occurred during the meteorite's residency on Earth. If returned as part of a sample suite from the martian surface, ordinary chondrites could preserve similar, recognizable evidence of putative past life and/or environmental change.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The pressure sensors on Mars rover Perseverance [1] are measuring the pressure field in the Jezero crater on a regular daily basis starting in sols 15-16. The data show the sol-to-sol seasonal evolution of the mean pressure field, driven by the CO2 condensation and evaporation cycle at the poles. During the period analyzed the mean daily pressure increased from 735 Pa on sols 15-20 (Ls = 13°-16°) to a maximum of 761 Pa on sols 99-110 (Ls = 52°-57°) and then gradually decreased to 738 Pa in sol 160 (Ls = 80°). The daily pressure cycle shows a rich sol-to-sol evolution dominated by the superposition of the different components of the thermal tides. From sols 15 to 160, the amplitude of the diurnal component (24 hr period) decreased from 9 to 1 Pa while the semi-diurnal component (12 hr) showed initially a decrease from 3.5 Pa to 0.4 Pa (sol 55) and then gradually increased to 7 Pa in sol 160. Simultaneously, the amplitude of the terdiurnal (8 hr) and quaddiurnal (6 hr) components showed variability and had a mean amplitude of about 2 Pa over the period analyzed. Superimposed on the diurnal cycle we detected the presence of numerous transient pressure drops of 0.5 - 7 Pa with typical durations 1-5 s generated by the passage of small vortices and dust devils. They occur mostly between 11 hr and 18 hr LTST, the insolation maximum hours. Other atmospheric disturbances of larger duration in the pressure field have also been captured along some sols and are under study. [1] Rodriguez-Manfredi et al. Space Sci. Rev. (2021)',\n",

None of the instruments in the Rover payload are life detection experiments for the purposes of planetary protection (PP). Nevertheless, a goal of the mission is to access areas of interest, including possible subsurface special regions, and to obtain and scientifically examine samples. Therefore the project has been categorized by NASA as COSPAR PP Category IVc. The entire flight system is subject to microbial reduction requirements, with additional specific emphasis on the sample acquisition and handling chain. Prior to the final design of the flight system, MSL performed analyses to show that the elements of the flight system will not cause a high probability of inadvertent biological contamination to Mars. The project is using a pinpoint landing system and will land in a non-special region on Mars, agreed to by the NASA Planetary Protection Officer. MSL has completed an approved Planetary Protection Plan and a PP Implementation Document. Planetary protection activities have begun with the start of flight system fabrication and assembly.

       "    'abstract': \"Deep learning (DL) has proven to be an effective machine learning and computer vision technique. DL-based image segmentation, object recognition and classification will aid many in-situ Mars rover tasks such as path planning and artifact recognition/extraction. However, most of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures are so complex that they are considered a 'black box'. In this paper, we used integrated gradients to describe the attributions of each neuron to the output classes. It provides a set of explainability tools (ET) that opens the black box of a DNN so that the individual contribution of neurons to category classification can be ranked and visualized. The neurons in each dense layer are mapped and ranked by measuring expected contribution of a neuron to a class vote given a true image label. The importance of neurons is prioritized according to their correct or incorrect contribution to the output classes and suppression or bolstering of incorrect classes, weighted by the size of each class. ET provides an interface to prune the network to enhance high-rank neurons and remove low-performing neurons. ET technology will make DNNs smaller and more efficient for implementation in small embedded systems. It also leads to more explainable and testable DNNs that can make systems easier for Validation \\\\&amp; Verification. The goal of ET technology is to enable the adoption of DL in future in-situ planetary exploration missions.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Department of Energy, Stirling Technology Company (STC), and NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) are developing a free-piston Stirling convertor for a high-efficiency Stirling Radioisotope Generator (SRG) for NASA Space Science missions. The SRG is being developed for multimission use, including providing electric power for unmanned Mars rovers and deep space missions. NASA GRC is conducting an in-house technology project to assist in developing the convertor for space qualification and mission implementation. Recent testing of 55-We Technology Demonstration Convertors (TDC's) built by STC includes mapping of a second pair of TDC's, single TDC testing, and TDC electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic compatibility characterization on a non-magnetic test stand. Launch environment tests of a single TDC without its pressure vessel to better understand the convertor internal structural dynamics and of dual-opposed TDC's with several engineering mounting structures with different natural frequencies have recently been completed. A preliminary life assessment has been completed for the TDC heater head, and creep testing of the IN718 material to be used for the flight convertors is underway. Long-term magnet aging tests are continuing to characterize any potential aging in the strength or demagnetization resistance of the magnets used in the linear alternator (LA). Evaluations are now beginning on key organic materials used in the LA and piston/rod surface coatings. GRC is also conducting finite element analyses for the LA, in part to look at the demagnetization margin on the permanent magnets. The world's first known integrated test of a dynamic power system with electric propulsion was achieved at GRC when a Hall-effect thruster was successfully operated with a free-piston Stirling power source. Cleveland State University is developing a multi-dimensional Stirling computational fluid dynamics code to significantly improve Stirling loss predictions and assist in identifying convertor areas for further improvements. This paper will update the status and results for these efforts. .\",\n",

Bucket-wheel excavation force increases approximately with the cube of excavation dimensions. The excavation forces were measured for bucket-wheels of different scales at proportionate depths and advance speeds, and these results were compared to predictions by excavation models. Analytical and empirical investigated models exhibit force scaling tendency similar to experiment despite their independent backgrounds.

The problem of invoking an appropriate computation model so that it will successfully complete a task while keeping its compute and energy costs within a budget is called a model selection problem. In this paper, we present an optimal solution to the model selection problem with two compute models, the first being fast but less accurate, and the second being slow but more accurate. The main insight behind our solution is that a robot should invoke the slower compute model only when the benefits from the gain in accuracy outweigh the computational costs. We show that such cost-benefit analysis can be performed by leveraging the statistical correlation between the accuracy of fast and slow compute models. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach to diverse problems such as perception using neural networks and safe navigation of a simulated Mars rover.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Mars Exploration Rovers began their journey to the red planet in the summer of 2003 and, in early 2004, will begin an unprecedented level of scientific exploration on Mars, attracting the attention of scientists and the public worldwide. In an effort to engage students and teachers in this exciting endeavor, NASA's Mars Public Engagement Office, partnering with the Athena Science Investigation, coordinates a student-scientist research partnership program called the Athena Student Interns Program. The Athena Student Interns Program \\\\(ASIP\\\\) began in early 1999 as the LAPIS program, a pilot hands-on educational effort associated with the FIDO prototype Mars rover field tests \\\\(Arvidson, 2000\\\\). In ASIP, small groups of students and teachers selected through a national application process are paired with mentors from the mission's Athena Science Team to carry out an aspect of the mission. To prepare for actual operations during the landed rover mission, the students and teachers participate in one of the Science Team's Operational Readiness Tests \\\\(ORTs\\\\) at JPL using a prototype rover in a simulated Mars environment \\\\(Crisp, et al., in press. See also http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/fido/\\\\). Once the rovers have landed, each ASIP group will spend one week at JPL in mission operations, working as part of their mentor's own team to help manage and interpret data coming from Mars. To reach other teachers and students, each group gives school and community presentations, contributes to publications such as web articles and conference abstracts, and participates in NASA webcasts and webchats. Partnering with other groups and organizations, such as NASA's Solar System Ambassadors and the Housing and Urban Development Neighborhood Networks helps reach an even broader audience. ASIP is evaluated through the use of empowerment evaluation, a technique that actively involves participants in program assessment \\\\(Fetterman and Bowman, 2002\\\\). With the knowledge they gain through the ASIP program and their participation in the empowerment evaluation, ASIP members will help refine the current program and provide a model for student-scientist research partnerships associated with future space missions to Mars and beyond.

       "    'abstract': 'ChemCam is a remote sensing instrument suite on board the \"Curiosity\" rover (NASA) that uses Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) to provide the elemental composition of soils and rocks at the surface of Mars from a distance of 1.3 to 7 m, and a telescopic imager to return high resolution context and micro-images at distances greater than 1.16 m. We describe five analytical capabilities: rock classification, quantitative composition, depth profiling, context imaging, and passive spectroscopy. They serve as a toolbox to address most of the science questions at Gale crater. ChemCam consists of a Mast-Unit (laser, telescope, camera, and electronics) and a Body-Unit (spectrometers, digital processing unit, and optical demultiplexer), which are connected by an optical fiber and an electrical interface. We then report on the development, integration, and testing of the Mast-Unit, and summarize some key characteristics of ChemCam. This confirmed that nominal or better than nominal performances were achieved for critical parameters, in particular power density (&gt;1 GW/cm<SUP>2</SUP>). The analysis spot diameter varies from 350 μm at 2 m to 550 μm at 7 m distance. For remote imaging, the camera field of view is 20 mrad for 1024×1024 pixels. Field tests demonstrated that the resolution (∼90 μrad) made it possible to identify laser shots on a wide variety of images. This is sufficient for visualizing laser shot pits and textures of rocks and soils. An auto-exposure capability optimizes the dynamical range of the images. Dedicated hardware and software focus the telescope, with precision that is appropriate for the LIBS and imaging depths-of-field. The light emitted by the plasma is collected and sent to the Body-Unit via a 6 m optical fiber. The companion to this paper (Wiens et al. this issue) reports on the development of the Body-Unit, on the analysis of the emitted light, and on the good match between instrument performance and science specifications.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign is one of the most ambitious and complex planetary exploration missions currently underway. With the participation of NASA, ESA, and a large number of industry partners, MSR aims to bring back Martian soil, rock, and atmospheric samples to answer key questions about Mars' biological evolution. To accomplish this goal the campaign relies on four coordinated missions, each fulfilling a fundamental role to safely bring the samples to Earth. The Mars Perseverance rover, the first of the four missions, landed safely on Mars on February 18, 2021 and has already acquired candidate samples for Earth return. A selection of the samples of Martian soil and atmosphere that Perseverance has captured during its mission will be recovered, launched into Mars orbit, and transported back to Earth. The Sample Fetch Rover and Mars Ascent System, both parts of the Sample Return Lander project, perform the Mars surface missions to retrieve the collected samples and launch them into Mars orbit. NASA's Capture, Containment, and Return System (CCRS), hosted on ESA's Earth Return Orbiter (ERO), brings the samples back to Earth from Mars orbit. These retrieval and return missions are currently in the planning and design stages of development. The NASA-provided CCRS is the payload of the ESA ERO and is the focus of this work. ERO will enter Mars orbit and provide communication relay to Earth for the other MSR elements. The Sample Return Lander systems will fetch the sample tubes and integrate them into a protective vessel - the Orbiting Sample (OS) system - which is then launched into low Mars orbit. ERO will perform rendezvous maneuvers, allowing its CCRS payload to capture the OS, contain it, and perform the first automated in-space assembly of a spacecraft, the Earth Entry System (EES), while in Mars orbit. ERO will then begin its journey back to Earth, with CCRS and its assembled EES spacecraft. Three days prior to arrival, CCRS will release the EES on an Earth entry trajectory from a distance beyond the orbit of the Moon. The passive EES spacecraft will then enter Earth's atmosphere, flying on a highly compact ballistic trajectory, followed by a terminal descent (without a parachute) and landing safely at the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR), USA. This work will show the current design of the CCRS system, and its concept of operations. ERO and CCRS will perform several firsts in planetary exploration: (a) orbital rendezvous and capture in Mars orbit, (b) in-space sterilization and containment, consistent with Category V restricted Earth return requirements, (c) on-orbit spacecraft assembly at Mars, and (d) precise fully-passive entry, descent, and landing sequence for sample return.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The University of Houston is in the process of developing a flexible program that offers children an in-depth educational experience culminating in the design and construction of their own model Mars rover. The program is called the Mars Rover Model Celebration (MRC). It focuses on students, teachers in grades 3-8. Students design and build a model of a Mars rover to carry out a student selected science mission on Mars. A total of 195 Mars Rover teachers from the 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015 cohorts were invited to complete the Mars Rover Teacher Evaluation Survey. The survey was administered online and could be taken at the convenience of the participant. A total of 1300 students from the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 cohort wereinvited to submit self-assessments of their participation in the program. Teachers were asked to rate their current level of confidence in their ability to teach specific topics within the Earth and Life Science realms, as well as their confidence in their ability to implement teaching strategies with their students. The majority of teachers (81-90%) felt somewhat to very confident in their ability to effectively teach concepts related to earth and life sciences to their students. In addition, many of the teachers felt that their confidence in teaching these concepts increased somewhat to quite a bit as a result of their participation in the MRC program (54-88%). The most striking increase in this area was the reported 48% of teachers who felt their confidence in teaching \"Earth and the solar system and universe\" increased \"Quite a bit\" as a result of their participation in the MRC program. The vast majority of teachers (86-100%) felt somewhat to very confident in their ability to effectively implement all of the listed teaching strategies. The most striking increases were the percentage of teachers who felt their confidence increased \"Quite a bit\" as a result of their participation in the MRC program in the following areas: \"Getting students interested in and curious about science\" (63%); \"Teaching science as a co-inquirer with students\" (56%); and \"Continually find better ways to teach science\" (59%). A key finding is that 354/365 responding students in the 2014-2015 cohort report substantial increase in science excitement owing to participation in the program.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'One of the primary challenges faced by the ChemCam instrument on the Curiosity Mars rover is developing a regression model that can accurately predict the composition of the wide range of target types encountered (basalts, calcium sulfate, feldspar, oxides, etc.). The original calibration used 69 rock standards to train a partial least squares (PLS) model for each major element. By expanding the suite of calibration samples to &gt;400 targets spanning a wider range of compositions, the accuracy of the model was improved, but some targets with \"extreme\" compositions (e.g. pure minerals) were still poorly predicted. We have therefore developed a simple method, referred to as \"submodel PLS\", to improve the performance of PLS across a wide range of target compositions. In addition to generating a \"full\" (0-100 wt.%) PLS model for the element of interest, we also generate several overlapping submodels (e.g. for SiO2, we generate \"low\" (0-50 wt.%), \"mid\" (30-70 wt.%), and \"high\" (60-100 wt.%) models). The submodels are generally more accurate than the \"full\" model for samples within their range because they are able to adjust for matrix effects that are specific to that range. To predict the composition of an unknown target, we first predict the composition with the submodels and the \"full\" model. Then, based on the predicted composition from the \"full\" model, the appropriate submodel prediction can be used (e.g. if the full model predicts a low composition, use the \"low\" model result, which is likely to be more accurate). For samples with \"full\" predictions that occur in a region of overlap between submodels, the submodel predictions are \"blended\" using a simple linear weighted sum. The submodel PLS method shows improvements in most of the major elements predicted by ChemCam and reduces the occurrence of negative predictions for low wt.% targets. Submodel PLS is currently being used in conjunction with ICA regression for the major element compositions of ChemCam data.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'According to climatological and geochemical studies, the climate of early Mars would have been semi-arid when the surface temperatures were above freezing. In such semi-arid climates, closed-basin lakes would have been created on early Mars; however, the hydrogeochemical cycles of the lake systems are poorly constrained. Mars rovers can acquire detailed geochemical data via in-situ measurements; nevertheless, the data are spatially limited near the landing sites. In this regard, field investigations of a terrestrial analog of Martian paleolakes would provide insights into the hydrogeochemical cycles. <P />Here we report results of our field surveys to terrestrial analogs of closed-basin lake systems that developed in cold and semi-arid climates; the Boon Tsagaan, Orog, and Olgoy lakes of the Valley of the Gobi Lakes of Mongolia. Our results show that groundwater plays a central role not only in hydrology, but also in geochemical cycles in the lake systems. We find that groundwater predominantly flows into the lakes through local seepage and regional flows in semi-arid climates. Through the interactions with calcite-containing soils, local groundwater seepage provides Ca and HCO<SUB>3</SUB> to the lakes. In the wetland located in between the lakes, high-salinity shallow pools would provide Cl and Na to the groundwater through infiltration. If similar processes occurred on early Mars, local seepage of groundwater would have provided magnesium and alkalinity to the early Jezero lakes, possibly leading to authigenic precipitation of lacustrine carbonates as suggested by Horgan et al. (2020). On early Mars, infiltration of surface brine may have transported salts and oxidants on the surface to lakes via regional groundwater flows, as proposed by Melwani Daswani and Kite (2017) and Mitra and Catalano (2019). We suggest that inflows of multiple types of groundwater in semi-arid climates could have caused redox disequilibria in closed-basin lakes on early Mars, which could have affected the past habitability.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"NASA's Mars 2020 mission has the twin goals of in-situ exploration of an ancient astrobiologically relevant site, and preparation and caching of samples for possible return to Earth by future missions. Mars 2020 will also test new technologies of potential value for future investigation of Mars.The rover draws heavily on the design of the Mars Science Laboratory, with new instruments and capabilities for the mission's specific objectives. The science payload includes a high resolution stereo zoom camera (Mastcam-Z), an instrument for remote characterization of rock chemistry and mineralogy (Supercam), a high resolution microscopic imager (Watson), instruments for elemental, organic chemistry, and mineralogical mapping at the 100 _m scale (PIXL, SHERLOC), a ground penetrating radar (RIMFAX), and an instrument to characterize environmental conditions (MEDA). An additional instrument (MOXIE) will demonstrate the conversion of atmospheric CO2 to O2 as a potential resource for future Mars exploration.As the first mission in a possible Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign, Mars 2020 has the capability to select, prepare, and cache about 35 rock core samples of about 15g each. To achieve very stringent organic, inorganic, and biologic contamination limits, the samples will be drilled using very clean hardware into ultraclean sample tubes. These tubes will be hermetically sealed immediately after collection. Eventually the rover will deposit these tubes at one or possibly more depots, accessible for individual retrieval at some time in the future. The sample tubes are designed to tolerate tens of years of environmental exposure on Mars and in orbit during the possible return journey.The fundamental concept of this mission is that the in-situ investigations provide the geologic data that is necessary to understand the landing site and simultaneously to select and document samples worthy of return to Earth. In support of this ambitious undertaking the Mars 2020 project has improved rover autonomy and provided tools for faster decision making.Three potential landing sites remain under consideration for Mars 2020. Jezero Crater is a crater lake site with a well-developed delta, Northeast Syrtis has evidence for shallow subsurface aqueous alteration, and a feature in the Columbia Hills may be a fossil hot spring. The final workshop leading to landing site selection will occur in early Fall, 2018.The Mars 2020 mission is now transitioning into the integration stage. It is scheduled to be launched in July or August 2020, and arrive at Mars in February 2021. Its prime mission will be at least one Mars year.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Much of Mars' Noachian-aged southern highlands is dissected by systems of fluvial channels and valleys &gt; 3.7 Ga in age. Arabia Terra, lying between the southern highlands and the northern lowlands, is similarly ancient, yet apparently has few valley networks. This regional lack of valley networks only matches Noachian precipitation predictions from climate models if the Noachian climate was dry and cold [1]. In this scenario, highlands dissection was caused by transient flows of meltwater from large, regionally restricted ice-bodies. However, new results [2,3] show that Arabia Terra is not as poorly dissected as previously thought, and in fact there are extensive networks of inverted channel systems. Here, we describe an example of such a system - Aram Dorsum - which has been studied extensively as an ExoMars Rover candidate landing site. Aram Dorsum is an ~100 km long, 1-2 km wide, branching, flat-topped ridge system, in western Arabia Terra. We have mapped the system using CTX images, DEMs and other data. We interpret the ridge system to be fluvial in origin, preserved in positive relief due to infill and differential erosion; this working hypothesis is used as a conceptual framework for the study. Aram Dorsum is a branching, multi-level, contributory network, set in surrounding floodplains-like material. This demonstrates that it was a relatively long-lived, aggradational fluvial system, rather than an erosional outflow or bedrock-carved fluvial channel. Interestingly, the system shows little evidence for unconfined lateral channel migration, so there must have been significant bank stability. Aram Dorsum was therefore probably once a sizable river and, as just one example of many similar systems, is an exemplar for the middle part of a regional sediment transport system that could have extended from the southern highlands to the northern lowlands. Like Aram Dorsum, many of these other recently-recognized fluvial systems have an origin more consistent with precipitation-driven surface runoff than transient meltwater flows. Their presence suggests that fluvial dissection in the Noachian was probably a more globally consistent process than previously thought. In 2018, the European Space agency will launch the Exo-Mars Rover to search for evidence of past life on Mars. Although Oxia Planum was chosen as prime 2018 site, Aram Dorsum is still in consideration for the 2020 backup launch date. A principal science objective for the Rover is to search for signs of past and present life on Mars, by drilling into the sub-surface. The Aram Dorsum region, being a relatively flat and hazard-free region containing buried and then exhumed, mid-Noachian fluvial/floodplains sediments provides an excellent opportunity for biosignature concentration and preservation and so for ExoMars to meet its science goals.

One experiment, the Alpha-Proton-X-ray Spectrometer, uses a sensor head placed against rocks and soil to determine their composition. To guarantee proper placement, a deployment mechanism mounted on the Mars Rover aligns the sensor head to within 20 deg of the rock and soil surfaces. In carrying out its task, the mechanism mimics the action of a human hand and arm. Consisting of a flexible wrist, a parallel link arm, a brush dc motor actuator, and a revolutionary non-pyrotechnic fail-safe release device, the mechanism correctly positions the sensor head on rocks as high as 0.29 m and on targets whose surfaces are tilted as much as 45 deg from the nominal orientation of the sensor head face. The mechanism weighs less than 0.5 kg, can withstand 100 g's, and requires less than 2.8 N x m of actuation torque. The fail-safe coupler utilizes Cerrobend, a metal alloy that melts at 60 C, to fuse the actuator and the rest of the mechanism together. A film heater wrapped around the coupler melts the metal, and Negator springs drive the mechanism into its stowed position. The fail-safe actuates using 6.75 Watts for 5 minutes in the event of an actuator failure.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"We present a light-weight body-terrain clearance evaluation algorithm for the automated path planning of NASA's Mars 2020 rover. Extraterrestrial path planning is challenging due to the combination of terrain roughness and severe limitation in computational resources. Path planning on cluttered and/or uneven terrains requires repeated safety checks on all the candidate paths at a small interval. Predicting the future rover state requires simulating the vehicle settling on the terrain, which involves an inverse-kinematics problem with iterative nonlinear optimization under geometric constraints. However, such expensive computation is intractable for slow spacecraft computers, such as RAD750, which is used by the Curiosity Mars rover and upcoming Mars 2020 rover. We propose the Approximate Clearance Evaluation (ACE) algorithm, which obtains conservative bounds on vehicle clearance, attitude, and suspension angles without iterative computation. It obtains those bounds by estimating the lowest and highest heights that each wheel may reach given the underlying terrain, and calculating the worst-case vehicle configuration associated with those extreme wheel heights. The bounds are guaranteed to be conservative, hence ensuring vehicle safety during autonomous navigation. ACE is planned to be used as part of the new onboard path planner of the Mars 2020 rover. This paper describes the algorithm in detail and validates our claim of conservatism and fast computation through experiments.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"NASA Headquarters is looking at possible missions to Mars to follow the proposed 2020 Mars rover mission currently in development. One option being considered is a multi-functional orbiter, launched in the early 2020's, whose capabilities could address objectives in the following areas: • Replenishment of the telecommunications and reconnaissance infrastructure presently provided by the aging Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiters; • Scientific and technical progress on the NRC Planetary Science Decadal Survey priorities, updated MEPAG Goals, and/or follow-up of new discoveries; • Location and quantification of in situ resources for utilization by future robotic and human surface-based missions; and • Data needed to address Strategic Knowledge Gaps (SKGs), again for possible human missions. The Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) was asked to prepare an analysis of possible science objectives and remote sensing capabilities that could be implemented by such a multi-purpose Mars orbiter launched in the 2022/24 timeframe. MEPAG conducted this analysis through formation of a Next Orbiter Science Analysis Group (NEX-SAG), which was chartered jointly by the NASA Science and Human Exploration Directorates. The SAG was asked to conduct this study within a range of mission capabilities, including the possible first use of Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) in the Mars system. SEP could provide additional power enabling new payload components and possible changes in orbit (e.g., orbital inclination change) that permit different mission observational campaigns (e.g., polar and non-polar). Special attention was paid towards identifying synergies between science investigations, reconnaissance, and resource/SKG needs. We will present the findings and conclusions of this NEX-SAG regarding possible objectives for the next NASA Orbiter to Mars.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'We address two problems associated with data-limited dynamic spacecraft exploration of the Solar System, in the context of multispectral imaging: data-prioritisation for transmission, and data-reduction for interpretation. We address these problems in tandem, in the special case where a target material is sought in an environment to inform a decision, and where the background environment materials have been inferred from prior observations. We present and explore a strategy for selecting and combining subsets of spectral images captured by a panoramic multispectral imager of a Mars rover, using prior information of the landing site materials obtained from orbit. We use a variety of candidate spectral reflectance signals for the expected target and background materials, sourced from publicly available spectral libraries. We re-sample these to the imager spectral resolution, and compute all available dimension reductions afforded by 4 common spectral parameter types. We then consider all possible paired combinations of these spectral parameters, and, simultaneously, find the optimal linear combination of each whilst evaluating the resultant target-background separation, using Linear Discriminant Analysis. We then verify the ability of the learned linear combinations to classify a with-held test dataset. We apply this method to the case of the ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover PanCam multispectral imager, and consider the problem of identifying hematite against a background of minerals expected to be found at the ExoMars rover landing site, Oxia Planum. We find that the separation score obtained through LDA trends with classification accuracy, but nonlinearly and with high variance, and conclude that classification accuracy should also be used to rank the spectral channel combinations. Finally, we demonstrate that the method can be extended to find the common minimal subset of features across a set of multiple separate target-background discrimination tasks.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Mars rover Opportunity has collected in situ compositional data with the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer at almost 500 sites. To analyze these data, hierarchical clustering analysis and an error-weighted similarity index are applied to a subset of 57 APXS target compositions and selected Martian meteorites. Hierarchical clustering provides a rapid first approximation of compositional relationships, whereas the error-weighted similarity index provides an in-depth and quantifiable comparison of individual composition pairs. These analyses are combined into a statistical grouping model that provides insight into lithologic relationships and is critically informed by examination of Panoramic Camera and Microscopic Imager images. Major lithologies are (1) the Burns formation sulfate sandstones; (2) Shoemaker impact breccias (Endeavour crater ejecta/rim deposits); (3) the morphologically distinct Grasberg formation, associated with Endeavour crater rim deposits; (4) the Matijevic formation, an exposure interpreted to be Endeavour crater target rocks; and (5) erratics or other rocks that do not cluster with groups 1-4. The Grasberg formation is more similar to the Shoemaker formation than any other formation, and thus likely incorporated eroded Shoemaker material. The lowest Shoemaker member (Copper Cliff breccia) may contain material from the preimpact Matijevic formation. The Matijevic formation is the most chemically distinct formation and is most similar to the volcanic erratic rock \"Marquette Island.\" Clustering and similarity index values also show that regolith breccia Martian meteorites (represented by the NWA 7475/7034 paired meteorites) are similar in bulk composition to Mars surface materials at Meridiani, especially the Matijevic formation.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Three generations of the Alpha-Particle-X-ray-Spectrometer (APXS) have been part of the science suite on all four landed NASA Mars rovers so far. Using x-ray spectroscopy following excitation with alpha particles and x-rays from 244Cm radioactive sources, so far about 2000 samples have been investigated along the combined traverse of ~85km on the surface of Mars.The APXS reports 16 standard elements in all samples and additional trace elements like Ge, Cu, Ga, Rb, Sr, As, Se, Y and Pb if at elevated levels. The sample spot of ~ 20 mm diameter is often large enough to represent bulk content, though small enough to reveal evidence for certain minerals through element correlations when oversampled in rasters. The results from all missions revealed large scale sedimentary formations, like Murray and Burns indicating specific environmental conditions in the past. The soil was found similar at all sites, representing a well mixed global crust component. APXS geochemical data were used for important constraints of complimentary mineralogy results, ground truth for orbiters and comparison to Martian meteorites.Results from the ongoing Curiosity mission and the long living MER rovers will be discussed. Additionally, some very successful applications and investigations that were serendipitously developed after launch will be reviewed. Part of the presentation will be devoted to the unique challenges, trade-offs during design and lessons learned from the long operation of the instrument. The combination of APXS, XRD and Moesbauer results from MER and MSL with future fine scale XRF results of the soil at the Mars 2020 landing site might shed a light into the enigmatic amorphous phase, which could represent a record of the past alteration processes on Mars.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Mars dust storms are an interdisciplinary field of research. They impact the entry-descent-landing operations of spacecraft, the energy production by the solar panels of Mars rovers and landers, and others. As can be foreseen, dust storms are also critical for the future human exploration of Mars. Dust storm research is directly aligned with the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) science objective on the lower atmosphere, and with the science objective of correlating the lower and upper atmosphere [1,2]. First results of EMM dust storm research were reported in [3].EMM has a high-altitude orbit and provides data products for studies of the Mars atmosphere and surface with a near-hemispheric view. Moreover, EMM can provide information on dust storm activity every few hours or less. EMM observed multiple dust storms during the primary mission, including a large regional dust storm in Sep. and Oct. 2022.The focus of this presentation are unique dust storm observations by the EMM camera EXI [4]. We study a subset of dust storms, which is of particular interest to our research. The formation and growth of dust storms is followed at a (sub-)hourly time scale. This includes results on the dust storm morphology, wind direction, wind speed, surface dust lifting, etc.. Based on that, the implications for the physics and dynamics of dust storms are considered.[1] Amiri, H.E.S., Brain, D., Sharaf, O. et al. The Emirates Mars Mission.

       "    'abstract': 'NASA\\'s Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Rover is equipped with a set of 12 engineering cameras. These cameras are build-to-print copies of the Mars Exploration Rover cameras described in Maki et al. (J. Geophys. Res. 108(E12): 8071, 2003). Images returned from the engineering cameras will be used to navigate the rover on the Martian surface, deploy the rover robotic arm, and ingest samples into the rover sample processing system. The Navigation cameras (Navcams) are mounted to a pan/tilt mast and have a 45-degree square field of view (FOV) with a pixel scale of 0.82 mrad/pixel. The Hazard Avoidance Cameras (Hazcams) are body-mounted to the rover chassis in the front and rear of the vehicle and have a 124-degree square FOV with a pixel scale of 2.1 mrad/pixel. All of the cameras utilize a 1024×1024 pixel detector and red/near IR bandpass filters centered at 650 nm. The MSL engineering cameras are grouped into two sets of six: one set of cameras is connected to rover computer \"A\" and the other set is connected to rover computer \"B\". The Navcams and Front Hazcams each provide similar views from either computer. The Rear Hazcams provide different views from the two computers due to the different mounting locations of the \"A\" and \"B\" Rear Hazcams. This paper provides a brief description of the engineering camera properties, the locations of the cameras on the vehicle, and camera usage for surface operations.',\n",

Simulations at 273 K and current martian atmosphere show that it is possible to simultaneously account for both chemical and mineralogical observations at the Meridiani landing site, but only when the amounts of water are small (water/rock mass ratio 1), the aqueous solutions are highly acidic (pH &lt; 3), and the lifetimes of liquid water are extremely short (on the order of tens of years). Furthermore, the best agreement between observations and models is obtained if evolved fluids are removed after alteration. If this simple self-consistent scenario is relevant to bedrock formation at Meridiani, it provides stringent constraints on the issues of where and when liquid water was present at the surface of Mars.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover observations of the 2018/Mars year 34 global/planet-encircling dust storm represent the first in situ measurements of a global dust storm with dedicated meteorological sensors since the Viking Landers. The Mars Science Laboratory team planned and executed a science campaign lasting approximately 100 Martian sols to study the storm involving an enhanced cadence of environmental monitoring using the rover's meteorological sensors, cameras, and spectrometers. Mast Camera 880-nm optical depth reached 8.5, and Rover Environmental Monitoring Station measurements indicated a 97% reduction in incident total ultraviolet solar radiation at the surface, 30K reduction in diurnal range of air temperature, and an increase in the semidiurnal pressure tide amplitude to 40 Pa. No active dust-lifting sites were detected within Gale Crater, and global and local atmospheric dynamics were drastically altered during the storm.

       "    'abstract': 'Mars orbiters, landers, and rovers have made extraordinary discoveries about the evolution of Mars and its potential for life. At this time, it is clear, that the potential of ancient life on Mars has increased based on several discoveries. There have been many observed signs of ancient liquid water: surface and underground. There are past geological environments on Mars that had reasonable potential to have preserved the evidence of life, had it existed. The detection of complex organics by Curiosity has increased the potential for preserving \"fingerprints of life\" that may be locked away in the rock record. These and other factors have led NASA, with the support of other space agencies, to mount a Mars sample return (MSR) campaign. The first mission of MSR is the Perseverance rover. Designed to core and store rock, soils, and atmospheric samples in sealed tubes for later return, Perseverance landed in Jezero crater in February 2021 near an extensive ancient river delta. Other missions will follow to bring these samples back to Earth for further analysis. In addition, Perseverance carried the Ingenuity helicopter as a technology demonstration which has been tremendously successful and may lead to other future ariel missions on the red planet.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The cumulative fractional area covered by rocks versus diameter measured at the Pathfinder site was predicted by a rock distribution model that follows simple exponential functions that approach the total measured rock abundance (19%), with a steep decrease in rocks with increasing diameter. The distribution of rocks &gt;1.5 m diameter visible in rare boulder fields also follows this steep decrease with increasing diameter. The effective thermal inertia of rock populations calculated from a simple empirical model of the effective inertia of rocks versus diameter shows that most natural rock populations have cumulative effective thermal inertias of 1700-2100 J m<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-0.5</SUP> K<SUP>-1</SUP> and are consistent with the model rock distributions applied to total rock abundance estimates. The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) airbags have been successfully tested against extreme rock distributions with a higher percentage of potentially hazardous triangular buried rocks than observed at the Pathfinder and Viking landing sites. The probability of the lander impacting a &gt;1 m diameter rock in the first 2 bounces is &lt;3% and &lt;5% for the Meridiani and Gusev landing sites, respectively, and is &lt;0.14% and &lt;0.03% for rocks &gt;1.5 m and &gt;2 m diameter, respectively. Finally, the model rock size-frequency distributions indicate that rocks &gt;0.1 m and &gt;0.3 m in diameter, large enough to place contact sensor instruments against and abrade, respectively, should be plentiful within a single sol's drive at the Meridiani and Gusev landing sites.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Missions to Mars prior to the year 2020 have indicated that Mars once held liquid water. This may have provided an environment suitable for the existence of microbial life. The primary science mission of Mars 2020 is to explore the past habitability of Mars and to prepare and cache a set of samples for potential return to Earth by a future mission. A second mission of Mars 2020 is to demonstrate technologies that can be used for human exploration of Mars. The mission duration of Mars 2020 is 1 Mars year, 668 sols or 1.88 Earth years. To fulfill the mission of Mars 2020, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) chose to send a rover, Perseverence, to the surface of Mars. Perseverance is the latest and most sophisticated Mars rover from NASA. It was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on July 30, 20201. After a cruise of approximately five and one-half months, it was successfully delivered to Jezero Crater on the surface of Mars on February 18, 2021. The pictures and video of its delivery were viewed with anticipation and awe around the world. However, some of us waited with equal anticipation for another moment, the posting of the first Mastcam-Z images. The Mars 2020 rover, Perseverance, includes 25 cameras, including 2 on the helicopter Ingenuity. There are 16 engineering cameras and 7 science cameras. Two of the science cameras enable the first-ever color imaging in stereo at variable magnification. These two cameras are the Mastcam-Z cameras, which are both mounted on the Remote Sensing Mast, separated by approximately 244 mm. The two Mastcam-Z cameras each make use of the first zoom lenses in interplanetary or deep space applications, which is the reason for the \"Z\" in the name of the camera (Mast Camera Zoom). In addition to their zoom capability, the lenses can be focused over a broad range of object distances. The optical design of these lenses is interesting in its development and deployment.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The success of a manned lunar outpost may require that indigenous resources be utilized in order to reduce the requirements for the periodic resupply from Earth for the human inhabitants. Some indigenous lunar resources do exist. For instance, studies of the lunar regoliths, acquired by the Apollo and Luna missions from several maria, indicate that upon heating in a vacuum, these soils evolve the volatile gases: helium (He), hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen (N2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The He, H, C, and N were originally implanted by solar wind These gases would be valuable to supply life-support systems. For instance, the H2 could be used as a rocket fuel, or alternatively, reacted with the mineral ilmenite (FeTiO3), indigenous to the lunar soil, to yield water (H2O). In an enclosed structure irradiated by solar energy, the H2O, N2, and CO2 could be utilized to grow edible plants for lunar inhabitants. Alternatively, the H2O could be electrolyzed, using photovoltaic cells, yielding breathable O. The inert gas He, would be useful for filling inflatable structures. In addition, the lunar He contains a high abundance of the rare isotopic He-3, which has been identified as a potentially valuable fuel for nuclear-fusion space power systems. In order to determine the economic potential of these lunar volatiles, we need information to assess the in situ quantities of these gases and identify the most abundant sites. In order to acquire such information, a large number of soil samples must be acquired and analyzed because it is not known if these volatile gases in the soil vary widely over the distance of a few meters or several kilometers. In addition, all of the lunar soil samples were analyzed on Earth, after being contaminated by terrestrial air and water. For these reasons, therefore, a mobile, robotic vehicle has been proposed that would be landed-on a lunar maria and assay the volatiles evolved by heating the indigenous lunar regolith. A lunar rover platform with the sample equipment attached has been designed. This science platform was conceptionally designed to fit on a small Marsokhod Rover (75 kg) with a 100-km range. The proposed sampling protocol would be to collect two samples, nearly adjacent. If the results agreed within the experimental deviation, the rover would proceed 0.5 km along the planned route and select two new samples. The progress of the rover and the results of the analyses would be continuously monitored from Earth so that the sampling protocol could be revised as needed. The scientific equipment would accomplish the assay of the regolith samples in the following sequence: (1) retrieve a sample of regolith from the lunar surface by use of a scoop mounted on the platform; (2) reduce the sample to about 1 g of particles &lt;200 pm; (3) weigh the sample; (4) characterize the mineral content (TiO2); (5) heat the sample to 1200C in a vacuum furnace; (6) collect the volatiles; (7) characterize the volatile products; and (8) transmit the data. The components of the scientific package were conceptually designed and are briefly described: (1) The heater unit. A 1 g sample of the surface regolith would be placed in a ferritic steel crucible 0.8 cm OD x 1.57 cm high. This container would be placed in a coiled electrical heater inside an evacuated 1-L container. Heat transfer calculations indicate that the sample would attain 1200C in 14 min with a 25-W heater. For a high-Ti maria regolith sufficient gases are released to create a pressure of 70 Pa at 30C, which is a sufficient sample for the mass spectrometer. (2) Determination of metallic elements. Before the sample is heated, a laser beam delivers 0.45-2.0 Joules per pulse at a wave length of 1 micron to the surface of the sample. The absorption of the laser energy vaporizes some of the minerals in the soils. The vaporized ions are quantitatively determined by the mass spectrometer. (3) Mass spectrometer. This instrument must be utilized to characterize the mineral content of the soil and the volatile gases, essentially from 1 to 72 AMU range. A Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometer (FTMS) may be particularly useful for this analysis, but requires testing. (4) Powersupply. The initial power subsystem assumed the availability of a general purpose heat source, or a Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator. If the launch of an RTG is forbidden for safety reasons, alternative power supplies would be considered such as solar-electric or beamed microwave sources.'},\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In order to meet the requirements of Mars rover test, the Mars surface illumination environment simulation system was developed, which is mainly composed of optical subsystem, mechanical and control subsystem. It can simulate the solar elevation angle at a large angle and solar spectrum on Mars surface, etc. It is of great significance for development of Mars rover and the improvement of its ability to perform space exploration missions. After the system was developed, six indexes including irradiance, spectrum, solar elevation angle, illumination area, irradiation uniformity and irradiation stability were evaluated according to the test standards. The irradiance meets the requirement of 0.3 solar constant in the direction of vertical illumination. The spectrum meets the spectral requirements of the landing area; Mars surface illumination environment simulation system can be simulated 75° ~ 90° solar elevation angle, at the same time can be simulated illumination area of more than 10 m × 10 m; The irradiation non-uniformity of this system is +/-14% ;Irradiation stability is expressed by irradiation instability, and the irradiation instability of the system is +/-4.5% within 2 hours continuously. At present, the Mars surface illumination environment simulation system has participated in the Mars rover test, and the illumination effect has been affirmed by the test department.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Mars2020 mission is NASA's newest flagship mission to Mars. The rover will land in Jezero Crater, a setting thought to have recorded sedimentary evidence of a past habitable environment. The Mars2020 team will characterize the site including a search for organics and potential biosignatures using its suite of scientific instruments. During the in situ phase of the mission, at least 20 rock and regolith cores consisting of a wide variety of well-documented samples will be collected in sealed containers for eventual return to Earth on a future mission. <P />The Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC) is an instrument mounted on the rover's robotic arm. It combines high spatial resolution imaging with UV resonance Raman and native deep UV fluorescence spectroscopic maps to identify potential biosignatures and address the aqueous history of Mars. Positioned by the robotic arm to investigate rock and regolith targets, a deep UV laser (248.6 nm) generates characteristic Raman and fluorescence photons within a 100 micron laser spot. <P />With the combination of deep UV fluorescence and deep UV Raman scattering, SHERLOC enables non-destructive, sub-picogram detection of organics and their spatial correlation to astrobiologically-relevant minerals, such as those associated with wet environments (e.g., carbonates, nitrates, phosphates, sulfates, etc.). These spatially correlated organic and mineral maps are an important component in differentiating between potential biogenicity, abiogenic formation, and meteoric contributions to Martian geologic materials. SHERLOC couples fine-scale imaging (10 um/pixel) with spectral maps that characterize organic, chemical, and mineral associations over scales that match petrographic-scale rock textures and structures (e.g., layers, veins, vugs), features that may have harbored and preserved microbial biosignatures. Finally, SHERLOC spectra can be combined with other measurements made by other payload elements, including remote mineralogical and elemental analysis enabled by SuperCam, and elemental abundances measured by PIXL (Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry) an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. We will present the current capabilities as demonstrated during pre-launch testing.\",\n",

As an introduction to several REMS-based articles in this issue, we provide an overview of the design and performance of the REMS sensors and discuss our approach to mitigating some of the difficulties we encountered following landing, including the loss of one of the two wind sensors. We discuss the REMS data set in the context of other Mars Science Laboratory instruments and observations and describe how an enhanced observing strategy greatly increased the amount of REMS data returned in the first 100 sols, providing complete coverage of the diurnal cycle every 4 to 6 sols. Finally, we provide a brief overview of key science results from the first 100 sols. We found Gale to be very dry, never reaching saturation relative humidities, subject to larger diurnal surface pressure variations than seen by any previous lander on Mars, air temperatures consistent with model predictions and abundant short timescale variability, and surface temperatures responsive to changes in surface properties and suggestive of subsurface layering.',\n",

This result based on data of active neutron measurements by DAN experiment aboard NASA\\'s Mars rover \"Curiosity\" in 412 sites along the 11 km of the rover traverse. In 78% of studied sites the distribution of water can be considered as homogeneous with average water content of 2.1 ± 0.5%. In 22% of sites the data suggest the two-layer model of the water distribution in the soil. The average water content in the top layer is about 2-3%, which is close to the value for site with the homogeneous distribution of water. In the first type of sites with two-layer water distribution, which constitute 8% of the total number, the data suggest the mass fraction of water 5.6 ± 2.7% in the bottom layer below the depth of 27 ± 18 cm. In the second type of sites with two-layer water distribution, which constitute 14% of the total number, data request much smaller fraction of water 1.2 ± 0.5% in the bottom layer below the depth of 14 ± 7 cm. For interpretation of the observations, one may suggest that the two types of regions exist in the Gale crater with high and low water content, which corresponds to different horizons of sediments formed in water and atmospheric environments, respectively.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The radiation robustness of a newly designed Wilkinson analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is being investigated. The ADC is a front-end design block within a cold capable, analog sense, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) manufactured using the IBM 0.5 μm silicon germanium (SiGe) BiCMOS 5HP process. The ASIC is part of a next-generation, cold capable, distributed motor controller architecture, which is a candidate for the next generation of Mars rovers. Its main function is to interface with various sensor types to monitor motor health (i.e., temperature, mechanical stress, pressure). While relatively well-hardened against total ionizing dose and destructive single-event latchup, the ADC showed some SEU (SET) sensitivity that is heavily dependent on its input channel configuration. For this study, we used a combination of experiments (pulsed-laser) and Cadence mixed-mode SEE simulations to explain the heavy ion irradiation results. We concluded that ADC input impedance configuration should be carefully controlled in the design of radiation-hardened systems for space.',\n",

In recent years several rovers and probes have reached disparate destinations such as the Moon, Mars, and even comets. As the scope of exploration becomes more ambitious, so do duration and complexity of the missions, and ultimately the size of vehicles being deployed. NASA Mars rover missions have navigated a combined total of more than 60 km on the surface of the red planet while missions to return samples from Mars back to earth are being planned. Recently, Japan succeeded in returning to Earth microscopic samples of soil from the near-Earth asteroid \"Itokawa\", and China successfully landed their \"Chang\\'e 3\" space probe on the Moon and operated the \"Yutu\" rover deployed by it, affording the first mobile lunar surface exploration since 1973.

       "    'abstract': \"Answering the question of whether life ever existed on Mars is a key goal of both NASA's and ESA's imminent Mars rover missions. The obfuscatory effects of oxidizing salts, such as perchlorates and sulfates, on organic matter during thermal decomposition analysis techniques are well established. Less well studied are the transformative effects of iron oxides and (oxy)hydroxides, which are present in great abundances in the martian regolith. We examined the products of flash pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (a technique analogous to the thermal techniques employed by past, current, and future landed Mars missions) which form when the cyanobacteria Arthrospira platensis are heated in the presence of a variety of Mars-relevant iron-bearing minerals. We found that iron oxides/(oxy)hydroxides have transformative effects on the pyrolytic products of cyanobacterial biomolecules. Both the abundance and variety of molecular species detected were decreased as iron substrates transformed biomolecules, by both oxidative and reductive processes, into lower fidelity alkanes, aromatic and aryl-bonded hydrocarbons. Despite the loss of fidelity, a suite that contains mid-length alkanes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons and/or aryl-bonded molecules in iron-rich samples subjected to pyrolysis may allude to the transformation of cyanobacterially derived mid-long chain length fatty acids (particularly unsaturated fatty acids) originally present in the sample. Hematite was found to be the iron oxide with the lowest transformation potential, and because this iron oxide has a high affinity for codeposition of organic matter and preservation over geological timescales, sampling at Mars should target sediments/strata that have undergone a diagenetic history encouraging the dehydration, dihydroxylation, and oxidation of more reactive iron-bearing phases to hematite by looking for (mineralogical) evidence of the activity of oxidizing, acidic/neutral, and either hot or long-lived fluids.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The wealth of observations now available from multiple spacecraft in orbit around Mars and rovers/landers on the surface provides information on several aspects of the atmosphere, although they are restricted in space and time. Most of the observational datasets are largely complementary, so an efficient method to combine them in a physically consistent way will lead to more constrained studies of the evolution of the global martian atmosphere. Data assimilation is one such method, combining multiple retrievals with a Mars Global Circulation Model (GCM) while accounting for errors in both sources of information and producing an optimal representation of the evolving martian surface and atmosphere. Data assimilation is a powerful tool in that multiple parameters each observed independently by different instruments (e.g. water vapour, ozone, carbon monoxide, dust opacity, temperature) are all realistically constrained and physically consistent at the same time, and unobserved parameters can also be influenced by assimilated data (e.g. water vapour assimilation will impact on the water ice distribution). It also allows for study of atmospheric features that change significantly between observations and identifying processes that lead to the observed changes. Data assimilation studies are prevalent on Earth and are becoming more mainstream for Mars, with several different Mars GCMs now capable of assimilating retrievals using different assimilation schemes. The Open University (OU) ExoMars modelling group Mars GCM has been combined with several retrieval datasets via data assimilation to study features of the ozone, carbon monoxide, water and dust cycles alongside dynamical features such as the polar vortices, surface warming during a global dust storm and planetary waves. OpenMARS (Open access to Mars Assimilated Remote Soundings), a publicly available global reanalysis dataset from 1999-2015, was also created using the OU assimilation system. This talk will give a brief overview of the benefits and limitations of data assimilation for Mars, and will demonstrate how combining retrievals of different atmospheric parameters with a Mars GCM via data assimilation leads to a better constrained analysis of the martian atmosphere than is possible with retrievals or GCMs alone.',\n",

The first five Mars years of Mars Exploration Rover data provide an unprecedented record of the dust load at two sites. This record is useful for characterization of the atmosphere at the sites and as ground truth for orbital observations. Atmospheric extinction optical depths have been derived from solar images after calibration and correction for time-varying dust that has accumulated on the camera windows. The record includes local, regional, and globally extensive dust storms. Comparison with contemporaneous thermal infrared data suggests significant variation in the size of the dust aerosols, with a 1 μm effective radius during northern summer and a 2 μm effective radius at the onset of a dust lifting event. The solar longitude (L<SUB>S</SUB>) 20-136° period is also characterized by the presence of cirriform clouds at the Opportunity site, especially near L<SUB>S</SUB> = 50° and 115°. In addition to water ice clouds, a water ice haze may also be present, and carbon dioxide clouds may be present early in the season. Variations in dust opacity are important to the energy balance of each site, and work with seasonal variations in insolation to control dust devil frequency at the Spirit site.',\n",

Using the Athena suite of instruments in a transect approach, a systematic series of overlapping panoramic mosaics, remote sensing observations, surface analyses, and trenching operations documented the lateral variations in landforms, geologic materials, and chemistry of the surface throughout the traverse, demonstrating the ability to apply the techniques of field geology by remote rover operations. Textures and shapes of rocks within the plains are consistent with derivation from impact excavation and mixing of the upper few meters of basaltic lavas. The contact between surrounding plains and crater ejecta is generally abrupt and marked by increases in clast abundance and decimeter-scale steps in relief. Basaltic materials of the plains overlie less indurated and more altered rock types at a time-stratigraphic contact between the plains and Columbia Hills that occurs over a distance of one to two meters. This implies that regional geologic contacts are well preserved and that Earth-like field geologic mapping will be possible on Mars despite eons of overturn by small impacts.',\n",

The rover is designed to operate in two modes: the 'roving' and 'rolling' modes. The roving mode is similar to many traditional wheeled rover designs and is useful for exploring relatively flat terrains. The rolling mode is intended to enable the rover to travel down steep slopes, such as those found in ravines and crater walls. In the rolling mode, the vehicle folds itself into a sphere and propels itself by shifting its center of mass. It does this by opening and closing the eight panels which form the surface of the sphere. The evaluation of this rolling mode is the primary focus of this paper. To that end, a spherical prototype TRREx has been designed, constructed, and tested. In addition, a mathematical model of the vehicle's rolling mode dynamics has been created. The performance of the physical prototype has been compared to simulation results and the qualitative agreement between the experimental and simulated results indicate that the mathematical model created for the vehicle's rolling mode dynamics captures the essential behavior of the vehicle.

A path tracking simulation is also included as a case study to highlight the ability of a TRREx vehicle to traverse a desired path.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Introduction: The Mars Helicopter, Ingenuity, is a technology demonstration carried on the Mars 2020 Rover, Perseverance. It is a free-flying, solar powered, ~1.8 kg coaxial spacecraft with counterrotating blades that can fly in the thin martian atmosphere [1]. It has demonstrated helicopter flight and operations on Mars and has transitioned into an operations demonstration to assist the rover. This abstract summarizes the first 19 flights of the mission and highlights science results and how Ingenuity has assisted the Mars 2020 Rover. Helicopter Deployment and Tech Demo: After landing, the rover acquired surface images to find a smooth, flat deployment and flight area free of rocks higher than 5 cm that was within an 80 m by 30 m flight zone. A location just north of where the rover landed was selected, the helicopter was deployed to the surface and the first 4 flights landed here. Flight #4 flew 135 m south to image a potential new landing site and then returned. After analysis of the helicopter images, the helicopter flew south and landed at this new airfield. Imaging Products: During flight, the helicopter routinely acquires nadir images with its wide angle, 0.3 megapixel Navigation Camera (Navcam). Substantial overlap allows production of orthomosaics and digital elevation models (DEMs). Each image is correlated and matched with three images before and after to get a variety of stereo disparity angles. These are combined and bundle-adjusted to create a single orthorectified mosaic and DEM of the terrain. At 5 m altitude, images are &gt;2 cm/pixel over a 10 m by 20 m area and can be used to identify ~10 cm diameter rocks; DEMs are at &gt;10 cm per elevation posting. A 13 megapixel color camera captures the surface from near nadir (with better than 1 cm/pixel at 5 m altitude) to the horizon. When the helicopter acquires side-by-side stereo color images separated by 5-7 m, DEMs and orthoimages can be produced. When flying at 5 m altitude, these images can easily resolve 10 cm diameter rocks. A total of 2,277 images have been returned from Ingenuity's cameras through flight #18. Of this total, 2,172 are Navcam images and 105 are color images. Localization: After each flight, the helicopter must be located in a map-based cartographic reference frame composed of a vertically and horizontally hierarchically controlled base map that includes the rover, which allows targeting of the helicopter with rover cameras, evaluation of telecom performance, and ensures a keep-out distance between the two spacecraft [2,3]. Orthomosaics, DEMs, and vertically projected images from the helicopter are georeferenced to the HiRISE basemap. Finding New Airfields in HiRISE Images: Prior to flight #4, HiRISE images were inspected for a smooth, flat location that was similar to rock-free terrains already imaged by the rover and helicopter. The location identified for the second airfield was then imaged by the helicopter in flight #4 to confirm it was rock free and suitable for landing before flying to, and landing, there during flight #5. Identifying new, safe airfields using just HiRISE images requires identifying rocks at the scale of a pixel. Rocks were identified based on their lighter color (white compared to the dark sand), or as light-dark pixel pairs of the illuminated and shadowed sides of a rock in the down sun direction [4] (similar to results at the InSight landing site [5]). Areas that appeared smooth and flat in HiRISE with no or very few possible rocks have been selected for landing flights #6-19 and all airfields identified have been safe, which has enabled the helicopter to take longer flights (including flight #9, 631 m) and to scout ahead of the rover. Landing on a Ripple: Large aeolian ripples with very coarse sand or granules covering their surfaces are common in Jezero crater. These bedforms are similar in many respects to megaripples on Earth [e.g., 6,7,8] as well as martian ripples encountered on previous rover missions. Measurements of Meridiani bedform slopes using rover stereo images show crest symmetry with low slopes of ~6° [9], more consistent with megaripples [8] than reversing dunes [10]. The airfield selected for flights #11-13 was 40 m in diameter and included a handful of ripples, and flight #12 landed on one of them. Upon landing, the onboard inertial measurement unit reported a 6° tilt, and the post-landing Navcam image confirms a granule to small pebble (1-5 mm) rich surface, supporting other observations interpreting these features as megaripples. Scouting for the Rover: The helicopter scouted into south Séítah during flight #12 and acquired advanced color stereo images for planning safe traverses into the region and the scientific exploration path. Drive options using the helicopter DEMs identified and characterized rocky hazards, sandy areas and aeolian bedforms at the rover wheel scale, and became a leading factor in the decision to undertake the exploration into south Séítah. The helicopter images of Séítah were also useful during tactical planning on sols 237 and 238, where they were used for identifying a traversable path. These images were used to identify the Caille and Village outcrops as compelling sites for in situ investigation and sample collection. Two sample cores were later collected from the Caille outcrop. Flight 10 over the Mont Rocheforte area, a candidate exploration site identified using orbital images, showed poorly exposed rock outcrops, resulting in the removal of this site from consideration. The helicopter acquired color stereo images looking south during flight 13 over the Faillefeu Séítah outcrop northwest of Perseverance's entry point into south Séítah that revealed underlying layered rocks with the same dip and strike as overlying Artuby ridge rocks. Geologic Mapping: Creating field reconnaissance geologic maps based on surface images overlayed on HiRISE images [11] has been greatly improved by the addition of helicopter images that provide a more synoptic view than surface images, but with a higher resolution than HiRISE. Geologic units are mapped in rover Navcam images out to about 30 m and helicopter images fill in between rover imaging positions that can exceed 100 m. References: [1] Balaram et al.

       "    'abstract': 'The analysis of the organic compounds present in the martian regolith is essential for understanding the history and habitability of Mars, as well as studying the signs of possible extant or extinct life. To date, pyrolysis, the only technique that has been used to extract organic compounds from the martian regolith, has not enabled the detection of unaltered native martian organics. The elevated temperatures required for pyrolysis extraction can cause native martian organics to react with perchlorate salts in the regolith and possibly result in the chlorohydrocarbons that have been detected by in situ instruments. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) extraction is an alternative to pyrolysis that may be capable of delivering unaltered native organic species to an in situ detector. In this study, we report the SCCO2 extraction of unaltered coronene, a representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), from martian regolith simulants, in the presence of 3 parts per thousand (ppth) sodium perchlorate. PAHs are a class of nonpolar molecules of astrobiological interest and are delivered to the martian surface by meteoritic infall. We also determined that the extraction efficiency of coronene was unaffected by the presence of perchlorate on the regolith simulant, and that no sodium perchlorate was extracted by SCCO2. This indicates that SCCO2 extraction can provide de-salted samples that could be directly delivered to a variety of in situ detectors. SCCO2 was also used to extract trace native fluorescent organic compounds from the martian regolith simulant JSC Mars-1, providing further evidence that SCCO2 extraction may provide an alternative to pyrolysis to enable the delivery of unaltered native organic compounds to an in situ detector on a future Mars rover.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Comprehensive analyses of remote sensing data during the three-year effort to select the Mars Exploration Rover landing sites at Gusev crater and at Meridiani Planum correctly predicted the atmospheric density profile during entry and descent and the safe and trafficable surfaces explored by the two rovers. The Gusev crater site was correctly predicted to be a low-relief surface that was less rocky than the Viking landing sites but comparably dusty. A dark, low-albedo, flat plain composed of basaltic sand and haematite with very few rocks was expected and found at Meridiani Planum. These results argue that future efforts to select safe landing sites based on existing and acquired remote sensing data will be successful. In contrast, geological interpretations of the sites based on remote sensing data were less certain and less successful, which emphasizes the inherent ambiguities in understanding surface geology from remotely sensed data and the uncertainty in predicting exactly what materials will be available for study at a landing site.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Introduction: The presence of carbonates on Mars is well-established, and they may have formed via different processes. While hydrothermal and lacustrine formation processes are well known, less is known about low-temperature, CO2-driven deposits, which may be more relevant for some carbonate deposits on Mars and icy moons. Crystal Geyser is located 14.5 km SE of Green River, UT, USA, and is part of a natural spring system along the Little Grand Wash fault [1]. This spring system is a rare example of a man-made low-temperature geyser [2] created in 1935 during exploration for oil and gas in the area [3]. Unlike a typical geothermally activated geyser, this spring system erupts due to large amounts of CO2 dissolved in water and underlying gas pressure. The consistent eruption of the geyser has created a gently sloping travertine mound a few meters thick consisting of precipitated carbonates, predominately composed of calcite, with aragonite increasing in concentration approaching the spring [4]. Carbonates are of interest for potential habitability and astrobiology for Mars and Icy moons due to their microbial preservation potential and their ability to record past environmental conditions [5, 6]. Methods: Each sample was analyzed as a whole rock, including weathered exterior surfaces, broken fresh surfaces, and polished interior surfaces, using various techniques described below. Reflectance and Raman spectroscopy of the samples was used to identify the mineralogy of the deposits and any characteristics unique to low-temperature, CO2-driven carbonate deposits, such as crystal preservation abilities or trace element composition. Subsamples were also crushed to &lt;45 µm powders for analysis by XRD and XRF. SEM+EDS with BSE was conducted on carbon-coated samples. Some of these analytical techniques are similar to instruments on current and future Mars rovers. Results: Reflectance spectroscopy was able to identify a mixture of calcite and aragonite in each sample collected from the site, as shown by the adsorption feature at ~2350 nm. Chlorophyll, ~675 nm, and quartz, ~2200 nm, were also present in some of the samples in minor quantities. XRD shows each sample as a mixture of calcite and aragonite with the presence of quartz in a few samples. Raman spectra indicated the presence of only calcite in some samples, only aragonite in other samples, and a mixture of both in some samples. This suggests that the sample is not transforming uniformly throughout, as Raman is testing a single spot of a sample. Raman also showed no organic signatures, likely due to the strong fluorescence masking the Raman signal. SEM was able to show microscale structures of calcite and aragonite crystals within the samples. SEM also showed the ability of carbonates to preserve and entomb microbes. XRF results identified major and selected minor elements in each sample. Discussion: This study suggests that the most effective way to detect calcite and aragonite is through Raman and reflectance spectroscopy. This study also confirms the ability of carbonates to preserve microbes that were detected by the SEM. The SuperCam instrument on the Perseverance rover has relevant instruments that should be able to identify carbonates, such as calcite or aragonite. Further analysis of the Crystal Geyser samples is expected to reveal additional features that allow low-temperature, CO2-driven carbonate precipitates to be distinguished from other types of carbonate deposits.

       "    'abstract': 'Water is a requirement for life as we know it. Indirect evidence of transient liquid water has been observed from orbiter on equatorial Mars, in contrast with expectations from large-scale climate models. The presence of perchlorate salts, which have been detected at Gale crater on equatorial Mars by the Curiosity rover, lowers the freezing temperature of water. Moreover, perchlorates can form stable hydrated compounds and liquid solutions by absorbing atmospheric water vapour through deliquescence. Here we analyse relative humidity, air temperature and ground temperature data from the Curiosity rover at Gale crater and find that the observations support the formation of night-time transient liquid brines in the uppermost 5 cm of the subsurface that then evaporate after sunrise. We also find that changes in the hydration state of salts within the uppermost 15 cm of the subsurface, as measured by Curiosity, are consistent with an active exchange of water at the atmosphere-soil interface. However, the water activity and temperature are probably too low to support terrestrial organisms. Perchlorates are widespread on the surface of Mars and we expect that liquid brines are abundant beyond equatorial regions where atmospheric humidity is higher and temperatures are lower.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Mars 2020 Rover is equipped with a next-generation engineering camera imaging system that represents a significant upgrade over the previous Navcam/Hazcam cameras flown on MER and MSL [1,2]. The Mars 2020 engineering cameras acquire color images with wider fields of view and higher angular/spatial resolution than previous rover engineering cameras. Additionally, the Mars 2020 rover will carry a new camera type dedicated to surface sample operations: the Cachecam. The Navcams provide stereo image data for rover traverse planning, targeting of remote sensing instruments, operation of the robotic arm, and the acquisition of panoramas with a 360° field of regard around the rover. The Hazcams acquire context images immediately forward and aft of the rover (in particular the areas not viewable by the Navcams) for traverse planning, robotic arm operations, support for rover fine positioning, and imaging of the front and rear wheels. Both the Navcam and Hazcam cameras provide stereo image data to the rover autonomous navigation system. The Cachecam, a new type of rover camera, will document sample handling operations inside the rover Sample Caching System (SCS). The Mars 2020 engineering cameras incorporate heritage design principles from MER/MSL [1-4]: 1) small, ruggedized camera bodies with fixed-focus lenses, 2) a simple camera head with limited processing and storage capabilities (image storage and compression functions are performed separately by the spacecraft/rover computer) and 3) cameras mounted together as stereo pairs (the Cachecam, a monoscopic camera, is an exception). The Mars 2020 engineering cameras are packaged into a single, compact camera head. Each of the Mars 2020 engineering cameras utilize a 20 megapixel AMS (CMOSIS) CMV20000 CMOS sensor equipped with a Bayer pattern RGB color filter array. The Mars 2020 Navcams are mounted on the pan/tilt Remote Sensing Mast (RSM) and will acquire color stereo images and panoramas from a height of approximately 2 meters above the Martian surface. The Mars 2020 Hazcams are hard-mounted to the rover body at a height of approximately 0.7 meters above the surface and will acquire color stereo images of the areas immediately in the front and rear of the rover. The Cachecam will acquire color images of sample materials as they are being processed. The Mars 2020 engineering cameras were delivered to the Mars 2020 project in the mid-2019 and integrated onto the rover shortly thereafter. The cameras have completed a variety of system tests in Mars 2020 ATLO, including thermal vacuum testing and geometric camera calibration. Performance of the cameras has been nominal during this period. Final prelaunch closeout imaging testing is scheduled for March of 2020. For a full description of the Mars 2020 engineering cameras, see [5]. The Mars 2020 launch window opens on July 17th, 2020, with landing on Mars scheduled for February 18th, 2021.

       "    'abstract': \"The first samples collected by the Mars 2020 mission represent units exposed on the Jezero Crater floor, from the potentially oldest Séítah formation outcrops to the potentially youngest rocks of the heavily cratered Máaz formation. Surface investigations reveal landscape-to-microscopic textural, mineralogical, and geochemical evidence for igneous lithologies, some possibly emplaced as lava flows. The samples contain major rock-forming minerals such as pyroxene, olivine, and feldspar, accessory minerals including oxides and phosphates, and evidence for various degrees of aqueous activity in the form of water-soluble salt, carbonate, sulfate, iron oxide, and iron silicate minerals. Following sample return, the compositions and ages of these variably altered igneous rocks are expected to reveal the geophysical and geochemical nature of the planet's interior at the time of emplacement, characterize martian magmatism, and place timing constraints on geologic processes, both in Jezero Crater and more widely on Mars. Petrographic observations and geochemical analyses, coupled with geochronology of secondary minerals, can also reveal the timing of aqueous activity as well as constrain the chemical and physical conditions of the environments in which these minerals precipitated, and the nature and composition of organic compounds preserved in association with these phases. Returned samples from these units will help constrain the crater chronology of Mars and the global evolution of the planet's interior, for understanding the processes that formed Jezero Crater floor units, and for constraining the style and duration of aqueous activity in Jezero Crater, past habitability, and cycling of organic elements in Jezero Crater.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Gale crater formed from an impact on Mars ~3.6 billion years ago. It hosts a central mound nearly 100 km wide and ~5 km high, consisting of layered rocks with a variety of textures and spectral properties. The oldest exposed layers contain variably hydrated sulphates and smectite clay minerals, implying an aqueous origin, whereas the younger layers higher on the mound are covered by a mantle of dust. Fluvial channels carved into the crater walls and the lower mound indicate that surface liquids were present during and after deposition of the mound material. Numerous hypotheses have been advocated for the origin of some or all minerals and layers in the mound, ranging from deep lakes to playas to mostly dry dune fields to airfall dust or ash subjected to only minor alteration driven by snowmelt. The complexity of the mound suggests that multiple depositional and diagenetic processes are represented in the materials exposed today. Beginning in August 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity will explore Gale crater by ascending the mound's northwestern flank, providing unprecedented new detail on the evolution of environmental conditions and habitability over many millions of years during which the mound strata accumulated.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The most recent planetary decadal survey, entitled Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022, provided a detailed set of priorities for solar system exploration. Those priorities drew on broad input from the U.S. and international planetary science community. Using white papers, town hall meetings, and open meetings of the decadal committees, community views were solicited and a consensus began to emerge. The final report summarized that consensus. Like many past decadal reports, the centerpiece of Vision and Voyages was a set of priorities for future space flight projects. Two things distinguished this report from some previous decadals. First, conservative and independent cost estimates were obtained for all of the projects that were considered. These independent cost estimates, rather than estimates generated by project advocates, were used to judge each project\\'s expected science return per dollar. Second, rather than simply accepting NASA\\'s ten-year projection of expected funding for planetary exploration, decision rules were provided to guide program adjustments if actual funding did not follow projections. To date, NASA has closely followed decadal recommendations. In particular, the two highest priority \"flagship\" missions, a Mars rover to collect samples for return to Earth and a mission to investigate a possible ocean on Europa, are both underway. The talk will describe the planetary decadal process in detail, and provide a more comprehensive assessment of NASA\\'s response to it.',\n",

In particular, in the physical sciences, limited training data may not adequately characterize future observed data; it is critical that models adequately indicate uncertainty, particularly when they may be asked to extrapolate. In our proposed model, structured conditional normalizing flows provide parsimonious latent representations that relate to the inputs through a Gaussian process, providing exact likelihood calculations and uncertainty that naturally increases away from the training data inputs. We demonstrate the methodology on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy data from the ChemCam instrument onboard the Mars rover Curiosity. ChemCam was designed to recover the chemical composition of rock and soil samples by measuring the spectral properties of plasma atomic emissions induced by a laser pulse. We show that our model can generate realistic spectra conditional on a given chemical composition and that we can use the model to perform uncertainty quantification of chemical compositions for new observed spectra. Based on our results, we anticipate that our proposed modeling approach may be useful in other scientific domains with high-dimensional, complex structure where it is important to quantify predictive uncertainty.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'If confirmed, the extremely low concentrations of methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>) detected in the Martian atmosphere may represent reservoirs and emission processes that would normally be considered negligible on Earth. One such process is the release of ancient volatiles from fluid inclusions and interstitial sites in rocks and minerals during erosion or geothermal activity. Using a highly sensitive rock-crushing and mass-spectrometry technique previously shown to detect CH<SUB>4</SUB> in serpentinites and hydrothermal mineral deposits, we have demonstrated that CH<SUB>4</SUB> and other ancient volatiles can be recovered from basalt, the dominant rock type on the Martian surface. Basalt samples from a wide range of ages and geological systems were tested, all of which released CH<SUB>4</SUB> when crushed. Oxidative weathering was associated with lower quantities of CH<SUB>4</SUB>. Otherwise, CH<SUB>4</SUB> recoverability showed no relationship with age or geological context. Mineral veins, cross-cutting one locality were found to share the volatile composition of the basalt. In general, the results suggest that CH<SUB>4</SUB>-release from ancient basalts could be a significant process on Mars, which could be further investigated by Martian rovers using a similar rock-crushing and mass spectrometry technique in situ.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Ancient environmental conditions on Mars can be probed through the identification of minerals on its surface, including water-deposited salts and cements dispersed in the pore space of sedimentary rocks. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) analyses by the Martian rover Curiosity's ChemCam instrument can indicate salts, and ChemCam surveys aid in identifying and selecting sites for further, detailed in situ analyses. We performed laboratory LIBS experiments under simulated Mars conditions with a ChemCam-like instrument on a series of mixtures containing increasing concentrations of salt in a basaltic background to investigate the potential for identifying and quantifying chloride, carbonate, and sulfate salts found only in small amounts, dispersed in bulk rock with ChemCam, rather than concentrated in veins. Data indicate that the presence of emission lines from the basalt matrix limited the number of Cl, C, and S emission lines found to be useful for quantitative analysis; nevertheless, several lines with intensities sensitive to salt concentration were identified. Detection limits for the elements based on individual emission lines ranged from 20 wt % carbonate (2 wt % C), 5-30 wt % sulfate (1-8 wt % S), and 5-10 wt % chloride (3-6 wt % Cl) depending on the basaltic matrix and/or salt cation. Absolute quantification of Cl, C, and S in the samples via univariate analysis depends on the cation-anion pairing in the salt but appears relatively independent of matrices tested, following normalization. These results are promising for tracking relative changes in the salt content of bulk rock on the Martian surface with ChemCam.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Mars Rover Opportunity selected drives over Cape York and Solander Point were simulated using ARTEMIS (Adams-based Rover Terramechanics and Mobility Interaction Simulator), a dynamic computer-based model for rover drives over realistic terrains. Artemis provides insight into how Opportunity responds in terms of rover 3D slip (defined as 100*(1 - actual discance / commanded distance)) and wheel sinkages on tilted surfaces to retrieve soil properties and to have a useful tool for path planning. Elevation data for the simulations were derived from HiRISE setereo observations, complemented by Navcam and Pancam-based elevation maps. Mechanical properties were estimated based on previous drives and tests in the JPL Mars Yard and Mojave Desert. Soil properties were assigned to map cells based on examination of image data and characterization of the extent of bedrock as opposed to soil exposures. Two models were tested: the deformable soil model using the classical terramechanics equations and the contact model using Coulomb's laws of friction. Both models were run and parameters adjusted to match the flight rover 3D slip and wheel sinkage data... The deformable soil model reproduced accurately the drives in terms of rover 3D slip and wheel sinkage. The longitudinal shear deformation modulus and soil cohesion were found to be the two main parameters that strongly impacted results by affecting the shear stresses and slip values. For example, on the uphill segment of Matijevic Hill driven on sol 3212, the simulation requirestwo types of soil over bedrock, one with a cohesion of 2500 Pa and a deformation modulus of 5 mm, and one with a lower cohesion of 1000 Pa and a deformation modulus of 10 mm, matching the geologic map over Matijevic Hill that displays a change in soil type at this location.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'We undertook a Mars rover-like deployment at a terrestrial analogue site consisting of active and relict perennial hypersaline springs at the East German Creek site in west-central Manitoba, Canada. This site serves as an analogue for possible long-lived springs on Mars. The deployment consisted of landing site-type investigations involving panoramic imagery from which regions of interest and targets of interest were selected for subsequent analysis by close-up imagery, and reflectance and Raman spectroscopy. These data were then used to prioritize samples for caching in the context of sample return. It was found that reflectance spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were complementary because they generally identified different minerals and phases. Reflectance spectra of the surfaces of whole rocks often differed from bulk powders of the same samples. Powdering of samples generally reduced the spectral contributions of the surface and grain coatings, allowing the identity of the \"bulk rock\" to be better determined. Raman spectra of powdered bulk samples were generally featureless due to induced fluorescence. Both spectroscopic techniques were equally effective at detecting biology at the site (cyanobacteria/chlorophyll). Biological activity could also be inferred from the crenulated texture of cyanobacterial mats. Post-deployment analysis of the samples was used to confirm and expand mineral identities, largely by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and elemental analysis. Mineral abundances, presence of phases undetectable by spectroscopy and XRD, and the pervasive presence of Fe oxyhydroxides could be addressed by X-ray fluorescence and wet chemistry. The deployment also provided valuable operational experience for current and next-generation planetary researchers. Overall, the results suggest that multiple analytical techniques, being the XRD, XRF, reflectance and Raman spectroscopy are highly complementary in exploring and characterizing a biology-hosting hypersaline springs environment. This work provides a framework for the value of different instruments for exploring similar sites on Mars, as the instrument from our field campaign have equivalents on the Perseverance and Rosalind Franklin rovers.',\n",

However, the extent to which weathering is responsible for secondary mineral formation on Mars is not clear. We are investigating plagioclase and pyroxene weathering and precipitation of iron oxyhydroxides and clays in regolith profiles developed on rocks of basaltic composition from three different sites (Pennsylvania, Virginia, Svalbard), located in very different climatic conditions. Two of these sites were formed under a cool temperate climate, while the Svalbard profile is formed in a dry polar climate that has been identified as a Mars analogue. The two sites located in the northeastern US show similar rates of plagioclase dissolution, while slower rates were observed at Svalbard. Depth of weathering is also much greater in Pennsylvania and Virginia than in Svalbard, where weathering has only proceeded since the last glaciation. Nonetheless, weathering in Svalbard is accelerated by spalling of altered surfaces, presumably due to temperature cycling. We are using a variety of techniques including Fe isotope measurements to better understand secondary mineral precipitation in regolith. Knowledge of the climatic effects upon these processes on Earth can ultimately be applied to better understand weathering mechanisms on Mars.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Traditional academic competitions that foster collaboration from student communities all around the globe have either been postponed indefinitely or cancelled due to restrictions posed upon in-person gathering. Owing to this, virtual competitions are gaining importance as they provide the student community with an outlet for exposure and academic growth whilst having the convenience of being online and safe. Mars Society South Asia (MSSA) has developed a software stack capable of replicating on-site competition tasks via ROS-based simulations. The software enables users to perform necessary simulations without them having to interact with ROS or Gazebo. Currently, the software has been set out to be used for the Virtual Mars Rover Challenge (VMRC), a competition that focuses on simulating the next generation of Mars rovers and thereby providing the student community with a substitute to their on-site competitions. The objective of this white paper is to explain the software architecture, installation, usage, maintenance and ease of use which is the singular most important factor in software adoption.',\n",

Mounted on the rover mast, the ChemCam instrument is designed to remotely determine the composition of soils and rocks located a few meters from the rover, using a Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometer (LIBS) coupled to a Remote Micro-Imager (RMI). We provide an overview of the diverse imaging investigations that were carried out by ChemCam\\'s RMI during the first year of operation on Mars. 1182 individual panchromatic RMI images were acquired from Sol 10 to Sol 360 to document the ChemCam LIBS measurements and to characterize soils, rocks and rover hardware. We show several types of derived imaging products, including mosaics of images taken before and after laser shots, difference images to enhance the most subtle laser pits, merges with color Mastcam-100 images, micro-topography using the Z-stack technique, and time lapse movies. The very high spatial resolution of RMI is able to resolve rock textures at sub-mm scales, which provides clues regarding the origin (igneous versus sedimentary) of rocks, and to reveal information about their diagenetic and weathering evolution. In addition to its scientific value over the range accessible by LIBS (1-7 m), we also show that RMI can also serve as a powerful long distance reconnaissance tool to characterize the landscape at distances up to several kilometers from the rover.',\n",

The Perseverance rover landed in Jezero crater in February 2021. We analyze images taken by the rover in the 3 months after landing. The fan has outcrop faces, which were invisible from orbit, that record the hydrological evolution of Jezero crater. We interpret the presence of inclined strata in these outcrops as evidence of deltas that advanced into a lake. In contrast, the uppermost fan strata are composed of boulder conglomerates, which imply deposition by episodic high-energy floods. This sedimentary succession indicates a transition from sustained hydrologic activity in a persistent lake environment to highly energetic short-duration fluvial flows.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Many scientists can attribute their careers to some kind of impressionable exposure to experimentation and research at an early age. However, children across the country receive varying levels of exposure to professional scientists depending upon local resources and socioeconomic composition. Outreach goals under this NSF-CAREER award are predicated on the idea that children can develop a life-long interest in science and mathematics at a very early age. The PI has focused on geoscience education to local K-6 students who might not otherwise get exposure to the field at a critical stage of their intellectual development. Working with educators at Northwestern's Center for Talent Development, the PI leads Earth science modules in Project Excite, a longitudinal program that recruits minority third-grade students from local elementary schools for a six-year program involving regular visits to the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. The primary goal is to boost minority enrollment in advanced placement courses in science and mathematics at Evanston Township High School. Hands-on demonstration modules have been developed on Mars rovers, renewable energy, as well as rock and mineral identification. Research under this CAREER award examines the role of silicate minerals in Earth's deep water cycle from atomic to geophysical scales. Under laboratory-simulated mantle conditions of 400-700 km depth, high-pressure minerals can incorporate a remarkable amount of water into their structures, resulting in modified physical properties. Experimental studies focus on determining hydration mechanisms at the atomic scale, and understanding the influence of hydration on the behavior of Earth materials at high pressures. Results will provide geophysical indicators of mantle hydration and facilitate detection of potential deep-mantle reservoirs of water remotely using seismic waves.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"A power system based on the Stirling Radioisotope Generator (SRG) has been identified for potential use on deep space missions, as well as for Mars rovers that may benefit from extended operation. The Department of Energy (DOE) has responsibility for developing the generator and the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is supporting DOE in this effort. The generator is based on a free-piston Stirling power convertor that has been developed by the Stirling Technology Company (STC) under contract to DOE. The generator would be used as a high-efficiency alternative to the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that have been used on many previous missions. The increased efficiency leads to a factor of 3 to 4 reduction in the inventory of plutonium required to heat the generator. GRC has been involved in the development of Stirling power conversion technology for over 25 years. The support provided to this project by GRC has many facets and draws upon the lab's scientists and engineers that have gained experience in applying their skills to the previous Stirling projects. This has created a staff with an understanding of the subtleties involved in applying their expertise to Stirling systems. Areas include materials, structures, tribology, controls, electromagnetic interference, permanent magnets, alternator analysis, structural dynamics, and cycle performance. One of the key areas of support to the project is in the performance testing of the free-piston Stirling convertors. Since these power convertors are the smallest, lowest power Stirling machines that have been tested at GRC, a new laboratory was equipped for this project. Procedures and test plans have been created, instrumentation and data systems developed, and Stirling convertors have been tested. This paper will describe the GRC test facility, the test procedures that are used, present some of the test results and outline plans for the future. .\",\n",

Consisting of three independent curriculum modules, K-12 students participate in inquiry-based engineering challenges to improve critical thinking skills and enhance problem solving skills. The Mars Rover Celebration Curriculum Module is designed for students in grades 3-8. Throughout this module, students learn about Mars and the solar system. Working with given design criteria, students work in teams to do basic research about Mars that will determine the operational objectives and structural features of their rover. Then, students participate in the design and construction of a model of a mock-up Mars Rover to carry out a specific science mission on the surface of Mars. At the end of this project, students have the opportunity to participate in a regional capstone event where students share their rover designs and what they have learned. The Electric Cargo Plan Curriculum Module is designed for students in grades 6-12. Throughout this module, students learn about aerodynamics and the four forces of flight. Working individually or in teams, students design and construct an electrically-powered model aircraft to fly a tethered flight of at least one lap without cargo, followed by a second tethered flight of one lap carrying as much cargo as possible. At the end of this project, students have the opportunity to participate in a regional capstone event where students share what they have learned and compete with their different cargo plane designs. The Space Weather Balloon Curriculum Module is designed for students in grades 9-12. Throughout this module, students learn and refine physics concepts as well as experimental research skills. Students participate in project-based learning that is experimental in nature. Students are engaged with the world around them as they collaborate to launch a high altitude balloon equipped with HD cameras. To better assist teachers in implementing one or more of these Curriculum Modules, teacher workshops are held to give teachers a hands-on look at how this curriculum is used in the classroom. And, to provide further support, teachers are each provided with an AIAA professional member as a mentor for themselves and/or their students. These curriculum modules, provided by AIAA are available to any K-12 teachers as well as EPO officers for use in formal or informal education settings.',\n",

The lateral and vertical distributions of these volatiles inform us of the processes that control the emplacement and retention of these volatiles, as well as helping to formulate in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) architectures. While significant progress has been made from orbital observations, measurements at a range of scales from centimeters to kilometers across the lunar surface are needed to generate adequate \"volatile mineral models\" for use in evaluating the resource potential of volatiles at the Moon. VIPER is a solar and battery powered rover mission designed to operate over multiple lunar days, traversing several kilometers as it continuously monitors for subsurface hydrogen and other surface volatiles. In specific thermal terrain types, including permanently shadowed terrain and locales that permit near-surface ice stability, subsurface samples will be examined for volatile content using a one-meter drill.

HiRISE will provide detailed images (0.25 to 1.3 m/pixel) covering ~1% of the Martian surface during the 2-year Primary Science Phase (PSP) beginning November 2006. Most images will include color data covering 20% of the potential field of view. A top priority is to acquire ~1000 stereo pairs and apply precision geometric corrections to enable topographic measurements to better than 25 cm vertical precision. We expect to return more than 12 Tb of HiRISE data during the 2-year PSP, and use pixel binning, conversion from 14 to 8 bit values, and a lossless compression system to increase coverage. HiRISE images are acquired via 14 CCD detectors, each with 2 output channels, and with multiple choices for pixel binning and number of Time Delay and Integration lines. HiRISE will support Mars exploration by locating and characterizing past, present, and future landing sites, unsuccessful landing sites, and past and potentially future rover traverses. We will investigate cratering, volcanism, tectonism, hydrology, sedimentary processes, stratigraphy, aeolian processes, mass wasting, landscape evolution, seasonal processes, climate change, spectrophotometry, glacial and periglacial processes, polar geology, and regolith properties. An Internet Web site (HiWeb) will enable anyone in the world to suggest HiRISE targets on Mars and to easily locate, view, and download HiRISE data products.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Linear, low-albedo patterns (termed dark wind streaks) formed on the floor of Gusev crater between September 2003 and February 2004, as seen on High Resolution Stereo Camera images taken on board the Mars Express Orbiter. Pancam images from the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit show that the rover crossed a dark streak during its traverse to Bonneville crater. Spirit Microscopic Imager data reveal that sand grains within the dark wind streak are relatively free of dust, whereas grains outside the streak are mantled with dust. During the September 2004 solar conjunction, Spirit remained in one location from sol 240 to sol 260. Comparison of images taken before and after the conjunction shows that patches of soil beneath the rover darkened with respect to the adjacent soils, suggesting removal of relatively bright material. Two MI mosaics taken 18 sols apart of the surface within 0.5 m of the nearest dark patch show that some larger (1-2 mm) sand grains moved as far as 0.7 mm. These observations support the hypothesis that some dark surface patterns result from the removal and/or repositioning of fine-grained material by winds, exposing a relatively lower albedo substrate, such as coarse sand grains. Other variable features on the Gusev floor seen from orbit faded between September 2003 and February 2004 and are interpreted to represent settling of dust from the atmosphere, consistent with the accumulation of dust observed on Spirit. The observation of dark streaks fading with time, while some dark streaks were newly formed, is consistent with local wind gusts or the passage of dust devils that locally sweep dust from the surface or cause a redistribution of fine grains among larger particles.',\n",

Based on principles derived from decision theory and decision analysis, a problem-solving approach is presented which can overcome many of the limitations of traditional expert-systems. This approach implements an explicit model of the human user's problem-solving capabilities as an integral element in the overall problem solving architecture. This integrated model, represented as an influence diagram, is the basis for achieving adaptive task sharing behavior between the associate system and the human user. This associate system model has been applied toward ongoing research on a Mars Rover Manager's Associate (MRMA). MRMA's role would be to manage a small fleet of robotic rovers on the Martian surface.

The thin martian atmosphere allows UV and ionizing radiation to damage potential chemical biosignatures at or below the surface. This effect, however, decreases with depth. Thus, organic molecules and potential biomarkers can be better preserved in the subsurface. The ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover is equipped with a drill able to collect samples from a maximum depth of 2 m for the first time on Mars. In this study we describe how we will use the drill telemetry information in combination with the rover subsurface instruments' data to better assess the stratification, compositional variations and connection with surface morphology. Understanding the subsurface sample environment is crucial to inform the investigations to be conducted on samples within the rover's Analytical Laboratory Drawer (ALD). Moreover, the synergic use of drill telemetry and the rover subsurface instruments' outcomes will inform planning of drilling activities and improve the selection of drilling sites.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Wind-related features observed by the rover Spirit in Gusev crater, Mars, include patches of soil on the surface, some of which are organized into bed forms. Windblown grains include dust (inferred to be &lt;3 μm in diameter), sands (up to a few hundred μm in diameter), and granules (&gt;2 mm in diameter). Microscopic Imager data show the sands and granules to be rounded and relatively spherical, typical of grains transported long distances by the wind. The interior of bed forms exposed by rover operations suggests the infiltration of dust among the grains, indicating that these sands are not currently experiencing saltation. Orientations of 1520 features (such as bed forms and ventifacts) along Spirit's traverse from the landing site (the Columbia Memorial Station) to West Spur in the Columbia Hills suggest primary formative winds from the north-northwest, which correlate with measurements of features seen in orbiter images and is consistent with afternoon winds predicted by atmospheric models. A secondary wind from the southeast is also suggested, which correlates with predictions for nighttime/early morning winds. Wind abrasion is indicated by ventifacts in the form of facets and grooves cut into rocks, the orientations of which also indicate prevailing winds from the north-northwest. Orientations of many aeolian features in the West Spur area, however, have more scatter than elsewhere along the traverse, which is attributed to the influence of local topography on the patterns of wind. Active dust devils observed on the floor of Gusev from the Columbia Hills demonstrate that dust is currently mobile. Sequential images of some dust devils show movement as rapid as 3.8 m/s, consistent with wind velocities predicted by atmospheric models for the afternoon, when most of the dust devils were observed. Sands accumulated on the rover deck in the same period suggest that some sands in the Columbia Hills experience active saltation. ``Two-toned'' rocks having a light band coating at their bases are considered to represent partial burial by soils and subsequent exposure, while ``perched'' rocks could represent materials lowered onto other rocks by deflation of supporting soils. Measurements of the heights of the light bands and the perched rocks range from &lt;1 cm to 27 cm, indicating local deflation by as much as 27 cm.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Sedimentary rocks at Yellowknife Bay (Gale crater) on Mars include mudstone sampled by the Curiosity rover. The samples, John Klein and Cumberland, contain detrital basaltic minerals, calcium sulfates, iron oxide or hydroxides, iron sulfides, amorphous material, and trioctahedral smectites. The John Klein smectite has basal spacing of ~10 angstroms, indicating little interlayer hydration. The Cumberland smectite has basal spacing at both ~13.2 and ~10 angstroms. The larger spacing suggests a partially chloritized interlayer or interlayer magnesium or calcium facilitating H<SUB>2</SUB>O retention. Basaltic minerals in the mudstone are similar to those in nearby eolian deposits. However, the mudstone has far less Fe-forsterite, possibly lost with formation of smectite plus magnetite. Late Noachian/Early Hesperian or younger age indicates that clay mineral formation on Mars extended beyond Noachian time.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The geomorphic expression of terrain provides information such as the underlying lithologic properties and the dominant surface processes. By examining the surface morphology of two impact craters on Mars that have been explored by rovers, we can synergistically combine orbital and ground observations to obtain a deeper insight into the geologic history. In this dissertation, we analyze the landscape evolution of Endeavour and Gale craters, which have been explored by the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers, respectively. This is accomplished largely by analyzing the topography on a larger scale using images from Mars orbiters and their associated Digital Elevation Models, combined with a smaller scale analysis of the topography from images taken by the Mars rovers. <P />Chapter 2 discusses the degradation and evolution of Endeavour crater. Orbital data from the Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiters (MRO) in combination with ground observations from the Opportunity rover is used to compare the topography of the relatively young Bopolu crater, to the nearby, and similar in size, Endeavour crater. Landscape evolution modeling is then implemented to simulate the degradation of Endeavour, and indicates that the crater experienced significant weathering and fluvial degradation during the Noachian period. The crater was then largely buried by the Burns formation sandstone, with only some segments of the rim remaining unburied. Aeolian erosion then modified the topography, exhuming sediment from the crater interior and eroding the rim. <P />Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the evolution of Gale crater, using observations from MRO, Mars Express, and the Curiosity rover. Chapter 3 characterizes debris deposits within chutes that are visible within multiple canyons on Mount Sharp, and concludes that they are late-stage landslide failures and debris flow deposits. Infinite slope modeling indicates that failure occurred by reduction in effective stresses due to increased pore water, which is interpreted to be caused by late-stage precipitation. Chapter 4 examines the geomorphic expression of the Glen Torridon region near the base of Mount Sharp, where the Curiosity rover has explored. Glen Torridon contains the upper members of the Murray formation, and is just below a thick section of sulfate-bearing strata. The Glen Torridon morphology consists of a series of benches of polygonally fractured bedrock and smooth terrain containing periodic bedrock ridges. Mineralogical data from MRO indicates that these two types of terrain have the same ferric smectite signatures. Wind erosion is hypothesized to be responsible for the different geomorphic expressions, with more erosion occurring in northern Glen Torridon. This may be due to the uppermost Murray formation experiencing more diagenetic alteration, therefore being more indurated than the underlying strata. <P />By using a combination ground and orbital observations at Endeavour and Gale craters, we have a better understanding of landscape evolution in two equatorial regions of Mars. In both areas, water was heavily involved in the evolution of the topography. At Endeavour crater, the rim was degraded from surface runoff, while at Gale crater, groundwater saturation and possibly exfiltration caused debris flows in the central mound. Both regions were later subjected to large amounts of wind erosion. At Endeavour, wind excavated some of the rim materials, creating its subdued appearance. At Gale crater, wind preferentially eroded the less indurated materials, creating ridges of resistant debris flow deposits, and terrain dominated by repeating benches and periodic bedrock ridges in Glen Torridon.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'From 1999-2006, the Glenn Research Center (GRC) supported a NASA project to develop a high-efficiency, nominal 110-We Stirling Radioisotope Generator (SRG110) for potential use on NASA missions. Lockheed Martin was selected as the System Integration Contractor for the SRG110, under contract to the Department of Energy (DOE). The potential applications included deep space missions, and Mars rovers. The project was redirected in 2006 to make use of the Advanced Stirling Convertor (ASC) that was being developed by Sunpower, Inc. under contract to GRC, which would reduce the mass of the generator and increase the power output. This change would approximately double the specific power and result in the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG). The SRG110 supporting technology effort at GRC was replanned to support the integration of the Sunpower convertor and the ASRG. This paper describes the ASRG supporting technology effort at GRC and provides details of the contributions in some of the key areas. The GRC tasks include convertor extended-operation testing in air and in thermal vacuum environments, heater head life assessment, materials studies, permanent magnet characterization and aging tests, structural dynamics testing, electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic compatibility characterization, evaluation of organic materials, reliability studies, and analysis to support controller development.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'We present an approach to enhance wheeled planetary rover dead-reckoning localization performance by leveraging the use of zero-type constraint equations in the navigation filter. Without external aiding, inertial navigation solutions inherently exhibit cubic error growth. Furthermore, for planetary rovers that are traversing diverse types of terrain, wheel odometry is often unreliable for use in localization, due to wheel slippage. For current Mars rovers, computer vision-based approaches are generally used whenever there is a high possibility of positioning error; however, these strategies require additional computational power, energy resources, and significantly slow down the rover traverse speed. To this end, we propose a navigation approach that compensates for the high likelihood of odometry errors by providing a reliable navigation solution that leverages non-holonomic vehicle constraints as well as state-aware pseudo-measurements (e.g., zero velocity and zero angular rate) updates during periodic stops. By using this, computationally expensive visual-based corrections could be performed less often. Experimental tests that compare against GPS-based localization are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach. The source code, post-processing scripts, and example datasets associated with the paper are published in a public repository.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Aeolian processes are probably the dominant ongoing surface process on Mars; Large Dark Dunes (LDDs), particularly common aeolian landforms, were first recognized in the early 1970s. Recent, higher resolution images have revealed another, morphologically distinct, large population of smaller, ripple-like aeolian bedforms that have been termed \"Transverse Aeolian Ridges\" (TARs) as it is unknown whether they formed as large ripples or small dunes. We have begun a new study of TARs that examines their distribution, orientation, and morphology using &gt; 10,000 high-resolution Mars Orbiter Camera (1.5 to 8 m/pixel resolution) images in a 45° longitude wide, pole-to-pole survey. The aim of this study is to assess whether TARs are active, to identify possible sediment sources and pathways, and to determine the volumes of sediment that they comprise. We present results from the first half of this study, in which we examine the northern hemisphere, and describe a new three-part classification scheme used to aid the survey. Our results show that TARs are abundant but not ubiquitous: preferentially forming proximal to friable, layered terrains such as those found in Terra Meridiani — the location of the ongoing Mars Exploration Rover \"Opportunity\" mission. TAR distribution in the northern hemisphere shows a strong latitudinal dependence with very few TARs being found north of ∼ 30° N. We also find that in most cases TARs are less mobile than LDDs, a conclusion possibly explained by Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity observations that show TAR-like ripples to have a core of fine material armored by a monolayer of granule-sized particles. This could disallow significant bedform movement under the current wind regime. That TARs are essentially inactive is confirmed by superposition relations with slope streaks and LDDs and by observations of superposed impact craters. We suggest that observations made by the Opportunity Rover in Terra Meridiani indicate that the small aeolian bedforms common here are ripples and not small dunes. Farther south, these bedforms transition into larger features indistinguishable from TARs, suggesting that TARs (in the Meridiani area at least) are ripples and not dunes.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The main objective of the ExoMars 2020 mission is to search for signs of past and/or present life on Mars. Toward this goal, a rover was designed to investigate the shallow subsurface which is the most likely place where signs of life may be preserved, beneath the hostile surface of Mars. The rover of the ExoMars 2020 mission has on board a polarimetric ground penetrating radar called WISDOM (Water Ice Subsurface Deposits Observation on Mars). Thanks to its large frequency bandwidth of 2.5 GHz, WISDOM is able to probe down to a depth of approximately 3 m on sedimentary rock with a vertical resolution of a few centimeters.The main scientific objectives of WISDOM are to characterize the shallow subsurface of Mars, to help understand the local geological context and to identify the most promising location for drilling. The WISDOM team is currently working on the preparation of the scientific return of the ExoMars 2020 mission. In particular, tools are developed to interpret WISDOM experimental data and, more specifically, to extract information from the radar signatures of expected buried reflectors. Insights into the composition of the ground (through the retrieval of its permittivity) and the geological context of the site can be inferred from the radar signature of buried rocks since the shape and the density of rocks in the subsurface is related to the geological processes that have shaped and placed them there (impact, fluvial processes, volcanism). This paper presents results obtained by automatic detection of structures of interest on a radargram, especially radar signature of buried rocks. The algorithm we developed uses a neural network to identify the position of buried rocks/blocs and then a Hough transform to characterize each signature and to estimate the local permittivity of the medium. Firstly, we will test the performances of the algorithm on simulated data constructed with a 3D FDTD code. This code allows us to simulate radar operation in realistic environments. Secondly, we will test our algorithm on experimental data acquired in a semi-controlled environment. Lastly, we will present experimental data acquired during a recent field campaign (July 2017) in the south of France and we will validate our method and illustrate the ability of WISDOM to provide clues about the geological context of a site.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover is a miniature geochemical laboratory designed to analyze martian atmospheric gases as well as volatiles released by pyrolysis of solid surface materials (Mahaffy et al., 2012). SAM began sampling the martian atmosphere to measure its chemical and isotopic composition shortly after Curiosity landed in Mars' Gale Crater in August 2012 (Mahaffy et al., 2013). Analytical methods and constants required for atmospheric measurements with SAM's quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) were provided in a previous contribution (Franz et al., 2014). Review of results obtained through application of these constants to repeated analyses over a full martian year and supporting studies with laboratory instruments offer new insights into QMS performance that allow refinement of the calibration constants and critical reassessment of their estimated uncertainties. This report describes the findings of these studies, provides updated calibration constants for atmospheric analyses with the SAM QMS, and compares volume mixing ratios for the martian atmosphere retrieved with the revised constants to those initially reported (Mahaffy et al., 2013). Sufficient confidence is enabled by the extended data set to support calculation of precise abundances for CO rather than an upper limit. Reanalysis of data acquired on mission sols 45 and 77 (at solar longitudes of 175° and 193°, respectively) with the revised constants leads to the following average volume mixing ratios: CO<SUB>2</SUB> 0.957(±0.016), N<SUB>2</SUB> 0.0203(±0.0003), Ar 0.0207(±0.0002), O<SUB>2</SUB> 1.73(±0.06)×10<SUP>-3</SUP>, CO 7.49(±0.026)×10<SUP>-4</SUP>.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The cratered plains of Gusev traversed by Spirit are generally low-relief rocky plains dominated by impact and eolian processes. Ubiquitous shallow, soil-filled, circular depressions, called hollows, are modified impact craters. Rocks are dark, fine-grained basalts, and the upper 10 m of the cratered plains appears to be an impact-generated regolith developed over intact basalt flows. Systematic field observations across the cratered plains identified vesicular clasts and rare scoria similar to original lava flow tops, consistent with an upper inflated surface of lava flows with adjacent collapse depressions. Crater and hollow morphometry are consistent with most being secondaries. The size-frequency distribution of rocks &gt;0.1 m diameter generally follows exponential functions similar to other landing sites for total rock abundances of 5-35%. Systematic clast counts show that areas with higher rock abundance and more large rocks have higher thermal inertia. Plains with lower thermal inertia have fewer rocks and substantially more pebbles that are well sorted and evenly spaced, similar to a desert pavement or lag. Eolian bed forms (ripples and wind tails) have coarse surface lags, and many are dust covered and thus likely inactive. Deflation of the surface ~5-25 cm likely exposed two-toned rocks and elevated ventifacts and transported fines into craters creating the hollows. This observed redistribution yields extremely slow average erosion rates of ~0.03 nm/yr and argues for very little long-term net change of the surface and a dry and desiccating environment similar to today's since the Hesperian (or ~3 Ga).\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The variety of spheroidal nodules on Earth and Mars share many common characteristics including variable mineral composition, different sizes, solid to rind type internal structures, and relationships to sedimentary textures and fabrics. The variations and expressions imply multiple waters and events, different populations, and a complex groundwater system(s) and alteration history over time. On Earth, concretions (cemented mineral masses) occur worldwide, throughout the geologic record from Precambrian to Holocene, and in many lithologies and depositional settings. Similarly, concretions are recognized and interpreted to form in a variety of environmental settings, multiple lithologies, and in several of the places that the recent Mars rovers have closely studied sedimentary rocks. These multiple occurrences suggest that fluid flow and mineral nucleation is a common secondary process in our solar system where there have been past waters. <P />To date, Earth concretions have reached very large sizes (m-scale) not yet recognized on Mars and many show a clear relationship to fossils, organics, and/or biomediation. Is the greater variety on Earth due to the prevalence of life in Earth's critical zone - permeating its surface and near-surface waters? Could the more extensive range of concretions on Earth be due to the greater abundance of water over longer time periods? These challenges may be addressed more fully as the Mars 2020 explores new terrains with new instruments that may yield biosignature evaluations at higher precision, adding to the rich knowledge inventory of diagenetic precipitates, enabling further comparisons to terrestrial analogs.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Two thermal models have been developed for a low mass (1.5 kg) Mars rover arm candidate instrument that employs a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) to cool a CCD focal plane. The Mineral Identification and Composition Analyzer (MICA) is a miniature instrument that employs X-ray scattering and visual imaging to determine nondestructively the mineralogy of a rock sample in-situ. Both thermal models incorporate the key components of MICA's CCD subsystem - CCD, heat sink, and lower radiator. The System Model includes the instrument's internal heat sources, including electronics, X-ray source, TEC dissipation, and the extreme diurnal temperature excursions of the ambient Martian atmosphere (~175 K to 255 K) and sky (~130 K to 200 K), convection (wind), and solar / IR radiation. The CCD Subsystem Model includes a passive thermal switch that provides heat sink cool-down by night and isolation by day. With or without the heat switch, TEC operation provides extended life for data collection at the upper end of the CCD operating range, ~ 208 K. Model parameter variation allows the instrument designer to optimize thermal capacities, thermal resistances, and internal heater power to hold critical electronics and mechanical components within their temperature operating limits. The charting feature of either model provides mechanical design guidance to ensure acceptable conditions for data collection over the experiment timeline.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Proterozoic carbonate stromatolites of the Pahrump Group from the Crystal Spring formation exhibit interesting layering patterns. In continuous vertical formations, there are sections of chevron-shaped stromatolites alternating with sections of simple horizontal layering. This apparent cycle of stromatolite formation and lack of formation repeats several times over a vertical distance of at least 30 m at the locality investigated. Small representative samples from each layer were taken and analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), environmental scanning electron microscopy - energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and were optically analysed in thin section. Optical and spectroscopic analyses of stromatolite and of non-stromatolite samples were undertaken with the objective of determining the differences between them. Elemental analysis of samples from within each of the four stromatolite layers and the four intervening layers shows that the two types of layers are chemically and mineralogically distinct. In the layers that contain stromatolites the Ca/Si ratio is high; in layers without stromatolites the Ca/Si ratio is low. In the high Si layers, both K and Al are positively correlated with the presence and levels of Si. This, together with XRD analysis, suggested a high K-feldspar (microcline) content in the non-stromatolitic layers. This variation between these two types of rocks could be due to changes in biological growth rates in an otherwise uniform environment or variations in detrital influx and the resultant impact on biology. The current analysis does not allow us to choose between these two alternatives. A Mars rover would have adequate resolution to image these structures and instrumentation capable of conducting a similar elemental analysis.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"For the first time, the Emirates Mars Infrared Spectrometer (EMIRS) instrument on board the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) 'Hope', is providing us with the temperature measurements of Mars at all local times covering most of the planet. As a result, it is now possible to compare surface temperature measurements made from orbit with those from the surface by rovers during the same time period. We use data of diurnal temperature variation from the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) suite on board the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) 'Curiosity' rover, and the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA) suite on board the Mars 2020 'Perseverance' rover, between June and August 2021 and compare them with EMIRS observations and estimates of the Mars Climate Database (MCD) model. We show that although the overall trend of temperature variation is in excellent agreement across missions, EMIRS measurements are systematically lower at night compared to Mars 2020. The lower spatial resolution of EMIRS compared to the rovers and consequently lower average thermal inertia of the observed regions in this particular case primarily contributed to this discrepancy, among other factors. We discuss the implications of these results in improving our understanding of the Martian climate which would lead to better modeling of local weather prediction, useful for future robotic and crewed missions.\",\n",

These robots must be able to traverse long distances over rough, unknown terrain autonomously, under severe resource constraints. Based on the authors' firsthand experience with the Mars Pathfinder mission, this paper reviews issues which are critical for successful autonomous navigation of planetary rovers. No currently proposed methodology addresses all of these issues. We next report on the 'Wedgebug' algorithm, which is applicable to planetary rover navigation in SE. The Wedgebug algorithm is complete, correct, requires minimal memory for storage of its worked model, and uses only on-board sensors, which are guided by the algorithm to efficiently senses only the data needed for motion planning. The implementation of a version of Wedgebug on the Rocky7 Mars Rover prototype at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is described, and experimental results from operation in simulated martian terrain are presented.\",\n",

The Spirit rover has supplied a diverse set of observations that are used here to better understand the formation of silica and the activity, abundance, and fate of water in the first hydrothermal system to be explored in situ on Mars. We apply spectral, chemical, morphological, textural, and stratigraphic observations to assess whether the silica was produced by acid sulfate leaching of precursor rocks, by precipitation from silica-rich solutions, or by some combination. The apparent lack of S enrichment and the relatively low oxidation state of the Home Plate silica-rich materials appear inconsistent with the originally proposed Hawaiian analog for fumarolic acid sulfate leaching. The stratiform distribution of the silica-rich outcrops and their porous and brecciated microtextures are consistent with sinter produced by silica precipitation.

Based on images obtained by the Curiosity rover, we interpret these outcrops as evidence for past fluvial, deltaic, and lacustrine environments. Degradation of the crater wall and rim probably supplied these sediments, which advanced inward from the wall, infilling both the crater and an internal lake basin to a thickness of at least 75 meters. This intracrater lake system probably existed intermittently for thousands to millions of years, implying a relatively wet climate that supplied moisture to the crater rim and transported sediment via streams into the lake basin. The deposits in Gale crater were then exhumed, probably by wind-driven erosion, creating Aeolis Mons (Mount Sharp).',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"A high density of REMS wind measurements were collected in three science investigations during MSL's Bagnold Dunes Campaign, which took place over ∼80 sols around southern winter solstice (Ls∼90°) and constituted the first in situ analysis of the environmental conditions, morphology, structure, and composition of an active dune field on Mars. The Wind Characterization Investigation was designed to fully characterize the near-surface wind field just outside the dunes and confirmed the primarily upslope/downslope flow expected from theory and modeling of the circulation on the slopes of Aeolis Mons in this season. The basic pattern of winds is 'upslope' (from the northwest, heading up Aeolis Mons) during the daytime (∼09:00-17:00 or 18:00) and 'downslope' (from the southeast, heading down Aeolis Mons) at night (∼20:00 to some time before 08:00). Between these times the wind rotates largely clockwise, giving generally westerly winds mid-morning and easterly winds in the early evening. The timings of these direction changes are relatively consistent from sol to sol; however, the wind direction and speed at any given time shows considerable intersol variability. This pattern and timing is similar to predictions from the MarsWRF numerical model, run at a resolution of ∼490 m in this region, although the model predicts the upslope winds to have a stronger component from the E than the W, misses a wind speed peak at ∼09:00, and under-predicts the strength of daytime wind speeds by ∼2-4 m/s. The Namib Dune Lee Investigation reveals 'blocking' of northerly winds by the dune, leaving primarily a westerly component to the daytime winds, and also shows a broadening of the 1 Hz wind speed distribution likely associated with lee turbulence. The Namib Dune Side Investigation measured primarily daytime winds at the side of the same dune, in support of aeolian change detection experiments designed to put limits on the saltation threshold, and also appears to show the influence of the dune body on the local flow, though less clearly than in the lee. Using a vertical grid with lower resolution near the surface reduces the relative strength of nighttime winds predicted by MarsWRF and produces a peak in wind speed at ∼09:00, improving the match to the observed diurnal variation of wind speed, albeit with an offset in magnitude. The annual wind field predicted using this grid also provides a far better match to observations of aeolian dune morphology and motion in the Bagnold Dunes. However, the lower overall wind speeds than observed and disagreement with the observed wind direction at ∼09:00 suggest that the problem has not been solved and that alternative boundary layer mixing schemes should be explored which may result in more mixing of momentum down to the near-surface from higher layers. These results demonstrate a strong need for in situ wind data to constrain the setup and assumptions used in numerical models, so that they may be used with more confidence to predict the circulation at other times and locations on Mars.\",\n",

Rover observations of two paleolacustrine sites at Gale and Jezero craters is providing new constraints on the nature and depositional conditions of the fan deposits. Terrestrial analogs are critical for accurate lacustrine reconstruction. Relatively under-considered for martian deltas are cold climate deltas, especially coarse-grained examples. The Patagonian upper Baker River basin is an excellent natural laboratory with a well-established climate and flood record that can be linked to the exposed deltaic architecture. <P />Chilean Lake General Carrera is an elongated basin (130 km x 20 km) east of the Andes Mountains that extends into Argentina where it is called Lake Buenos Aires. Over a dozen deltas at LGC developed during a series of lake lowering events since the breakup of the Patagonian Ice Field ~15 ka. The deltas have a classic Gilbert form with a braided river on the top surface and a steeply inclined front. The last major lake lowering event, from 320 masl to present level 201 masl, occurred after 6.2 ± 0.8 ka. This study describes the sedimentary architecture for the lowest exposed delta terrace outcrops at five sites, with ties to climatically-induced flow conditions. <P />The youngest perched deltas exhibit inclined foreset beds overlain by 10-30 m thick horizontally stratified topset strata with a sharp truncation surface. Topset beds are dominantly comprised of rounded pebble and cobbles (minor sand), with interbedded meter-size boulders (5-30% by volume). Seasonal floods recorded in three stream gauges have maximum daily discharge sufficient to transport cobble-size clasts, but threshold conditions for boulders are only achieved in glacial outburst events. Regionally, such catastrophic floods had a multi-century recurrence interval until the last 2 ka. <P />The glacio-fluvial LGC delta model should be considered for select Mars delta reconstruction, and has ramifications on flood triggering mechanisms, formation timescales and associated climate conditions. Importantly, if ice-release events played a role, the total duration for delta formation is significantly lengthened.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The NASA Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission has been exploring Jezero Crater since landing on February 18, 2021. The purpose of the mission is to investigate the geology, evaluate past habitability, look for signs of ancient life, and collect a suite of scientifically compelling samples for potential future return to Earth – the latter as part of an international Mars Sample Return campaign. <P />Noachian-aged Jezero Crater was once the site of a delta-lake system with a high potential for habitability. Perseverance carries 38 identical sample tubes designed for rock core or regolith, and five \"witness tubes\" for characterizing contamination from the rover. As of the completion of the Crater Floor Campaign in mid-March, 2022, Perseverance has sealed 10 tubes: 8 rock cores (representing 4 distinct rocks, collected in pairs), one tube in which inadvertently no core was acquired but which does include a serendipitous sample of ambient atmosphere, and one witness tube – a tube designed to capture contamination from the spacecraft. Whereas a number of different origins for the crater floor rocks were postulated based on orbital data, the result of exploration by Perseverance demonstrates that the crater floor rocks have an igneous origin. These rocks were mapped into two formations: Seítah and Máaz. The rocks investigated and sampled in Seítah are olivine cumulates that have been altered by fluids. The Máaz formation consists of a series of lava flows that have experienced variable degrees of fluid interaction. The 8 rock cores collected from the crater floor have high potential to address several important objectives of Mars Sample Return, including the magmatic history of Mars, geochronology, water-rock interactions, and whether an environment conducive to life existed on the crater floor after these igneous rocks were emplaced. <P />As of May 2022, the Delta Front Campaign is underway, with the first ever sedimentary samples collected in the summer. This campaign seeks to characterize the geology of the lowermost rock units in the delta, and collect representative samples of sedimentary rocks that could be used to look for ancient biosignatures in labs on Earth – a key goal of the Mars Sample Return effort. <P />By the end of the Delta Front Campaign, it is expected that Perseverance will have collected several additional sedimentary samples, a regolith sample, and additional witness tubes. A subset of the samples collected are planned to be placed in a cache near the delta front. The set of samples on board the rover will be carried along and added to, during the exploration of Jezero Crater and beyond.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) has recently begun using its gimbaled optical system to acquire observations in which hyperspectral pixels are spatially overlapping in the along-track direction. At the time of this writing, along-track oversampled (ATO) observations of 35 scientifically interesting targets on Mars have been acquired, including data which have been used to tactically guide the Opportunity Mars rover in the exploration of Santa Maria and Endeavour craters at Meridiani Planum [Arvidson et al., this conference]. ATO data are also currently scheduled to be acquired over Curiosity's selected landing site at Gale Crater, with an emphasis on coverage of possible rover traverse paths. Here we describe the properties of the ATO dataset and demonstrate the value of these observations in comparison with normal CRISM full resolution targeted (FRT) ~18 m/pixel data. To first order, along-track pixel overlap allows spectra from deposits at the scale of the CRISM's highest spatial resolution to have a greater chance of being captured by a single pixel rather than split between adjacent pixels. Additionally, techniques designed to take advantage of the spatial overlap of pixels may be used to process ATO data to resolutions smaller than ~18 m/pixel. Along-track pixel spacing at the scale of meters rather than tens of meters in combination with geometric lookup tables (GLT) allow ATO data to be projected to spatial resolutions much smaller than normal FRT observations. Previously undetectable small scale features as small as ~3 m become visible in these improved-resolution images. Additionally, more sophisticated mathematical methods that take into account the trade-off between increased spatial resolutions with decreased signal-to-noise are applied to the ATO CRISM data. These methods, which were originally developed for application to terrestrial microwave radiometer systems, result in the generation of sub-18 m pixels and employ estimations of CRISM's instrument noise and knowledge of its along-track point-spread function.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A full polarimetric antenna system on board the ExoMars rover is part of the Experiment \"Water Ice and Subsurface Deposit Observations on Mars\" (WISDOM). The WISDOM-Experiment is a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) selected to be part of the Pasteur payload aboard the rover of the ExoMars mission. The Pasteur Panoramic Instruments (wide angle camera PANCAM, infrared spectrometer MIMA and WISDOM) will perform large-scale scientific investigations at the sites the Rover will visit. Among these instruments, WISDOM is the only one that can provide a view of the subsurface structure prior to drilling. WISDOM is the first space borne GPR aboard a rover and has been designed to characterize the shallow subsurface structure of Mars. WISDOM will give for the first time access to the geological structure, electromagnetic nature, and, possibly, of hydrological state of the shallow subsurface by retrieving the layering and properties of the buried reflectors. It will address some important related science questions regarding the planet present state and past evolution. The measured data will also be used to determine the most promising locations at which to obtain underground samples with the drilling system mounted on board the rover. The instrument objective for WISDOM is to get high-resolution measurements down to 2-meters depth in the Martian crust. The radar is a gated step frequency system covering the frequency range from 500 MHz to 3 GHz. The radar is fully polarimetric and makes use of four ultra wideband Vivaldi antennas. This poster describes the requirements, the design and the realization of the WISDOM antenna system accommodated on the ExoMars rover. Simulated antenna performance and measured antenna parameters as well as preliminary antenna test measurements performed in the lab and in permafrost regions on earth will be discussed in this poster presentation. The main design requirements of the WISDOM antenna system are driven one hand by the required science return of the Experiment and on the other hand by the specific GPR configuration and accommodation on the Mars Rover. The resolution of a few centimetres and a penetration depth of more than two meters results in a bandwidth of 2.5 GHz. To be able to study depolarization effects in the subsurface a fully polarimetric antenna system is required. To realize the best radar performance the antenna system is equipped with two perpendicular linear polarized transmitting antennas and two co- and cross-polar oriented antennas for reception. Usually GPR antennas are placed on ground or accommodated in a close-by ground configuration with respect to the wavelength. Considering the requirements for the design of the ExoMars rover the GPR antenna system has to have a ground clearance of about 30 cm, which is equal to 3 wavelengths for the highest operating frequency. Taking into account that the GPR antennas on the rover are not able to use the advantages of a close-by ground arrangement and that due to mass, volume and planetary protection requirements the application of absorbing material and reflectors are not appropriate, the antenna pattern of each single antenna element should be directed towards ground and should provide a large forward to backward ratio. The radiation pattern should be wide in rover path direction, so that a visibility of point reflectors for long distance is possible. The across path pattern should be narrow. These and other constraints like EMC requirements as well as pattern deformation due to radiation coupling effects with the rover structure led to an antenna design that is based on two perpendicular oriented Vivaldi structures for each antenna. The antennas will be covered by thin dielectric foil to protect the sensitive parts from Martian dust particles. The overall size of the dual polarized transmitting and receiving antenna is less than 20 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm. The total mass for a whole antenna unit is about 200 g. Taking into account all the requirements, a very powerful space qualified broad band antenna system is developed and successfully tested in different environments.'},\n",

While stationary, extra Doppler tracking was performed in order to allow an improved estimate of the martian precession rate. In this study, we determine Mars rotation by combining the new Opportunity tracking data with historic tracking data from the Viking and Pathfinder landers and tracking data from Mars orbiters (Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter). The estimated rotation parameters are stable in cross-validation tests and compare well with previously published values.

       "    'abstract': 'The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover completed a detailed investigation at the Kimberley waypoint within Gale crater from sols 571-634 using its full science instrument payload. From orbital images examined early in the Curiosity mission, the Kimberley region had been identified as a high-priority science target based on its clear stratigraphic relationships in a layered sedimentary sequence that had been exposed by differential erosion. Observations of the stratigraphic sequence at the Kimberley made by Curiosity are consistent with deposition in a prograding, fluvio-deltaic system during the late Noachian to early Hesperian, prior to the existence of most of Mount Sharp. Geochemical and mineralogic analyses suggest that sediment deposition likely took place under cold conditions with relatively low water-to-rock ratios. Based on elevated K<SUB>2</SUB>O abundances throughout the Kimberley formation, an alkali feldspar protolith is likely one of several igneous sources from which the sediments were derived. After deposition, the rocks underwent multiple episodes of diagenetic alteration with different aqueous chemistries and redox conditions, as evidenced by the presence of Ca-sulfate veins, Mn-oxide fracture fills, and erosion-resistant nodules. More recently, the Kimberley has been subject to significant aeolian abrasion and removal of sediments to create modern topography that slopes away from Mount Sharp, a process that has continued to the present day.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Events such as the Mars rover landings bring much public attention and provide excellent reasons for substantive educational outreach to educators and the public. In the fall of 2003, the Space Science Institute (SSI) of Boulder, Colorado (USA) led the refurbishment and redeployment of the 5000 sq. ft MarsQuest traveling exhibition. Prior to this, MarsQuest had completed a highly successful 3-year tour of the US. Earlier in 2003, SSI launched the 600 sq. ft. ``mini-MarsQuest'' exhibit called Destination Mars. This paper will report on the lessons we have learned regarding the educational programming associated with these exhibits. In this context, ``educational programming'' refers to: 1) workshops for museum educators and docents at exhibit host sites; 2) workshops for local educators who will bring their students to visit the exhibit; 3) materials and resources to support science center programming such as school-group visits, family days, and camp-ins; and 4) public talks by scientists. We will focus this paper on our 3 years of experience with the Mars exhibits, plus the results of a formal evaluation being conducted in collaboration with Randi Korn &amp; Associates. The lessons learned will be of great value to the educational programming of future SSI traveling exhibits. In addition, we expect that many of our lessons learned will be of broader value to any scientist or educator who works in collaboration with science centers and museums.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Home Plate is a layered plateau observed by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit in the Columbia Hills of Gusev Crater. The structure is roughly 80 m in diameter, and the raised margin exposes a stratigraphic section roughly 1.5 m in thickness. Previous work has proposed a pyroclastic surge, possibly followed by aeolian reworking of the ash, for the depositional origin for these beds. We have performed a quantitative analysis of the structure, stratigraphy, and sedimentology at this location. Our results are consistent with an explosive volcaniclastic origin for the layered sediments. Analysis of bedding orientations over half of the circumference of Home Plate reveals a radially inward dipping structure, consistent with deposition in the volcanic vent, or topographic draping of a preexisting depression. Detailed observations of the sedimentology show that grain sorting varies significantly between outcrops on the east and west sides. Observations on the western side show a well-sorted population of sand sized grains which comprise the bedrock, while the eastern margin shows a wider range of grain sizes, including some coarse granules. These observations are consistent with primary deposition by a pyroclastic surge. However, aeolian reworking of the upper stratigraphic unit is not ruled out. Identification of explosive volcanic products on Mars may implicate magma interaction with subsurface hydrologic reservoirs in the past.',\n",

Mastcam-Z consists of a pair of focusable, 4:1 zoomable cameras that provide broadband red/green/blue and narrowband 400-1000 nm color imaging with fields of view from 25.6° × 19.2° (26 mm focal length at 283 μrad/pixel) to 6.2° × 4.6° (110 mm focal length at 67.4 μrad/pixel). The cameras can resolve (≥ 5 pixels) ∼0.7 mm features at 2 m and ∼3.3 cm features at 100 m distance. Mastcam-Z shares significant heritage with the Mastcam instruments on the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover. Each Mastcam-Z camera consists of zoom, focus, and filter wheel mechanisms and a 1648 × 1214 pixel charge-coupled device detector and electronics. The two Mastcam-Z cameras are mounted with a 24.4 cm stereo baseline and 2.3° total toe-in on a camera plate ∼2 m above the surface on the rover's Remote Sensing Mast, which provides azimuth and elevation actuation. A separate digital electronics assembly inside the rover provides power, data processing and storage, and the interface to the rover computer. Primary and secondary Mastcam-Z calibration targets mounted on the rover top deck enable tactical reflectance calibration. Mastcam-Z multispectral, stereo, and panoramic images will be used to provide detailed morphology, topography, and geologic context along the rover's traverse; constrain mineralogic, photometric, and physical properties of surface materials; monitor and characterize atmospheric and astronomical phenomena; and document the rover's sample extraction and caching locations. Mastcam-Z images will also provide key engineering information to support sample selection and other rover driving and tool/instrument operations decisions.\",\n",

Seven areas, five of which contain specific high-priority landing ellipses, are investigated: Hematite (two sites), Isidis Planitia, Elysium Planitia (two sites), Valles Marineris, and Gusev Crater. The last two locations are in regions of extreme topography, and the local and regional thermal circulations that result are equally extreme. Horizontal wind speeds near the floor of Valles Marineris exceed 50 ms<SUP>-1</SUP>. Vertical velocities near the walls exceed 40 ms<SUP>-1</SUP> and penetrate 10 km in altitude above the rim of the canyon. Thermal convection is suppressed within Valles Marineris by subsidence that forms in response to the upslope flows along the canyon walls. Wind magnitudes at Gusev crater are approximately one third of those at the canyon, but horizontal wind shear is greater. Deep convective thermals are noted at the relatively flat Hematite site, where 10 ms<SUP>-1</SUP> updrafts rising to heights of 5 km are not uncommon during the midafternoon. Linearly organized convective updrafts superimposed on upslope circulations dominate over most of Isidis Planitia. Hexagonal and linearly organized convection predominates at Elysium Planitia. Afternoon circulations at all sites pose some risk (significant risk in some cases) to entry, descent, and landing. Most of the atmospheric hazards are not evident in current observational data and general circulation model simulations and can only be ascertained through mesoscale modeling of the region.',\n",

The plains are predominantly float rocks and soil derived from olivine basalts. Outcrops at West Spur and on Husband Hill have experienced pervasive aqueous alteration as indicated by the presence of goethite. Olivine-rich outcrops in a possible mafic/ultramafic horizon are present on Haskin Ridge. Relatively unaltered basalt and olivine basalt float rocks occur at isolated locations throughout the Columbia Hills. Basalt and olivine basalt outcrops are found at and near Home Plate, a putative hydrovolcanic structure. At least three pyroxene compositions are indicated by MB data. MB spectra of outcrops Barnhill and Torquas resemble palagonitic material and thus possible supergene aqueous alteration. Deposits of Fe<SUP>3+</SUP>-sulfate soil, located at Paso Robles, Arad, and Tyrone, are likely products of acid sulfate fumarolic and/or hydrothermal activity, possibly in connection with Home Plate volcanism. Hematite-rich outcrops between Home Plate and Tyrone (e.g., Montalva) may also be products of this aqueous activity. Low water-to-rock ratios (isochemical alteration) are implied during palagonite, goethite, and hematite formation because bulk chemical compositions are basaltic (SO<SUB>3</SUB>-free basis). High water-to-rock ratios (leaching) under acid sulfate conditions are implied for the high-SiO<SUB>2</SUB> rock and soil in Eastern Valley and the float rock FuzzySmith, which has possible pyrite/marcasite as a hydrothermal alteration product.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity touched down at Meridiani Planum in January 2004 and since then has been conducting observations with the Athena science payload. The rover has traversed more than 5 km, carrying out the first outcrop-scale investigation of sedimentary rocks on Mars. The rocks of Meridiani Planum are sandstones formed by eolian and aqueous reworking of sand grains that are composed of mixed fine-grained siliciclastics and sulfates. The siliciclastic fraction was produced by chemical alteration of a precursor basalt. The sulfates are dominantly Mg-sulfates and also include Ca-sulfates and jarosite. The stratigraphic section observed to date is dominated by eolian bedforms, with subaqueous current ripples exposed near the top of the section. After deposition, interaction with groundwater produced a range of diagenetic features, notably the hematite-rich concretions known as ``blueberries.'' The bedrock at Meridiani is highly friable and has undergone substantial erosion by wind-transported basaltic sand. This sand, along with concretions and concretion fragments eroded from the rock, makes up a soil cover that thinly and discontinuously buries the bedrock. The soil surface exhibits both ancient and active wind ripples that record past and present wind directions. Loose rocks on the soil surface are rare and include both impact ejecta and meteorites. While Opportunity's results show that liquid water was once present at Meridiani Planum below and occasionally at the surface, the environmental conditions recorded were dominantly arid, acidic, and oxidizing and would have posed some significant challenges to the origin of life.\",\n",

Outcrops of aqueous origin are composed of 15 to 35% by volume magnesium and calcium sulfates [a high-silica component modeled as a combination of glass, feldspar, and sheet silicates (~20 to 30%)], and hematite; only minor jarosite is identified in Mini-TES spectra. Mini-TES spectra show only a hematite signature in the millimeter-sized spherules. Basaltic materials have more plagioclase than pyroxene, contain olivine, and are similar in inferred mineral composition to basalt mapped from orbit. Bounce rock is dominated by clinopyroxene and is close in inferred mineral composition to the basaltic martian meteorites. Bright wind streak material matches global dust.

NASA GRC is conducting an in-house supporting technology project to assist in developing the Stirling convertor for space qualification and mission implementation. Preparations are underway for a thermal/vacuum system demonstration and unattended operation during endurance testing of the 55-We Technology Demonstration Convertors.

Long-term magnet aging tests are continuing to characterize any possible aging in the strength or demagnetization resistance of the permanent magnets used in the linear alternator. Testing of the magnet/lamination epoxy bond for performance and lifetime characteristics is now underway. These efforts are expected to provide key inputs as the system integrator, LM, begins system development of the SRG. GRC is also developing advanced technology for Stirling convertors. Cleveland State University (CSU) is progressing toward a multi-dimensional Stirling computational fluid dynamics code, capable of modeling complete convertors. Validation efforts at both CSU and the University of Minnesota are complementing the code development. New efforts have been started this year on a lightweight convertor, advanced controllers, high-temperature materials, and an end-to-end system dynamics model.

The rover will use a drill to obtain samples from up to 2m below the Martian surface that will then be analysed using a variety of analytical instruments, including the Raman Laser Spectrometer (RLS), which will be the first Raman spectrometer to be used on a planetary mission.To prepare for ExoMars RLS operations, we report on a series of experiments that have been performed in order to investigate the response of a representative Raman instrument to a number of analogue samples (selected based on the types of material known to be important, following investigations performed by NASA's Mars Science Laboratory, MSL, on the Curiosity rover). Raman spectroscopy will provide molecular and mineralogical information about the samples obtained from the drill cores on ExoMars. MSL acquires similar information using the CheMin XRD instrument which analyses samples acquired from drill holes several centimetres deep. Like Raman spectroscopy, XRD also provides information on the mineralogical makeup of the analysed samples.The samples in our study were selected based on CheMin data obtained from drill sites at Yellowknife Bay, one of the first locations visited by Curiosity (supplemented with additional fine scale elemental information obtained with the ChemCam LIBS laser instrument). Once selected (or produced), the samples were characterised using standard laboratory XRD and XRF instruments (in order to compare with the data obtained by CheMin) and a standard, laboratory based LIBS system (in order to compare with the ChemCam data). This characterisation provides confirmation that the analogue samples are representative of the materials likely to be encountered on Mars by the ExoMars rover.A representative, miniaturised Raman spectrometer was used to analyse the samples, using acquisition strategies and operating modes similar to those expected for the ExoMars instrument. The type of minerals detected are identified and compared to the information typically acquired using other analytical science techniques investigating in order to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of using Raman spectroscopy for planetary science applications.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A critical part of landed Mars missions is the opportunity to conduct detailed investigations of rock outcrops comparable to those done in terrestrial field geology. In doing so, the record of past processes and environments can be read and interpreted in detail. However, our ability to accurately interpret some aspects of this record on Mars is questionable. One particular challenge lies in distinguishing deposits from dilute pyroclastic density currents (DPDCs) from eolian and fluvial deposits, all of which can produce sandy cross-stratified accumulations. While bedforms in eolian and fluvial deposits are well characterized, there is an insufficient understanding of bedform kinematics and sediment transport processes in DPDCs on Earth. Here we report initial findings from fieldwork at several terrestrial DPDC deposits, and criteria that may be used to distinguish them from eolian and fluvial environments, particularly when geologic context is limited. Several prime examples of DPDC deposits are exposed in southern New Mexico at the Afton craters (Kilbourne Hole and Hunts Hole), and northern Arizona in the Hopi Buttes volcanic field (Teshim Butte, Haskie Volcano, and Triplets Maar). Fieldwork was conducted to mirror the types of data available for Mars rover missions. Preliminary results indicate several characteristics that may be used to identify DPDC deposits on Mars, including grain size and sorting, preservation of dune crests and stoss sides, supercritical angles of climb, angles of stoss and lee slopes, trends in transport direction, and components such as accretionary lapilli and volcanic bombs. Ongoing work will refine the range of bedform properties anticipated for DPDC deposits through comparison across multiple terrestrial sites, and predictions for Mars. This study recognizes the challenge in distinguishing DPDC in remote sensing data, but highlights the importance of terrestrial analogs to better understand processes and environments that may be identified on Mars.',\n",

Despite the irregular shape of realistic granular intruders, most research focus on the settling of \"perfect\" objects like spheres and cylinders. Here, we systematically explore the penetration of \"imperfect\" solids—from stones to bodies with carefully controlled asymmetries—into granular beds. A cylinder with two halves of different roughnesses rotates toward the granular region next to the smoother surface and deviates from the vertical direction. We demonstrate that even small irregularities in the surface of an object may produce substantial changes in the penetration process. Using computer simulations, we show that defects concentrate granular force chains, thus producing decisive forces on the intruder. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tilting and migration of sinking bodies can be correctly predicted by a simple mechanical model based on a unified force law. Imperfect objects sink imperfectly in granular matter due to the unexpected large effect of small irregularities… skulls included.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"One of the most striking differences between the present day climates of Earth and Mars is the ubiquitous and abundant presence of liquid water on Earth and the extremely dry atmosphere and surface of Mars. Features on the surface of Mars, discovered by early spacecraft missions in the 1970s and apparently caused by flowing water on the surface in the past, have lead to much speculation concerning the early Martian climate and the possibility that the planet was once relatively warm and wet. Such speculation is fuelled by the search for life on Mars, either in the present or as a fossil record. Until recent missions, however, there has been little direct evidence for the existence of large water deposits, other than in the form of ice, largely around the northern polar cap. During the past 2 years, however, NASA's Mars Odyssey and ESA's Mars Express spacecraft have discovered evidence for considerable amounts of ice lying at relatively shallow depths in the Martian regolith. The NASA Mars Rovers have also found considerable in situ evidence for ancient water in the nearby rocks and landscape.\",\n",

High contrast spectra that are comparable to those obtained from macroscopic measurements have been obtained in dark field mode from rough, unprepared samples of jarosite, alunite, olivine, gibbsite, and other minerals and test targets. The scale of roughness of the samples is consistent with that obtained from a typical Mars rover rock abrasion tool. Spectral discrimination and spatial resolution are demonstrated at the sharp boundaries between two different minerals. The confocal and bright field modes are shown to suffer from previously known potential artifacts, but the usefulness of the confocal mode in establishing optimum focus automatically remains.

OPSIAL supports both the local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (LTE) or partial LTE conditions and takes account of line broadenings due to the Doppler effect and collisions with electrons and other pseudo colliders in the plasma. An algorithm for fully automatically identifying elemental species and retrieving plasma parameters based on observed plasma emission spectra has been implemented into OPSIAL. The structure and theoretical framework of OPSIAL, together with a case study of using OPSIAL to analyze laser-induced breakdown spectral data of the ChemCam instrument onboard the Mars rover Curiosity, are presented.',\n",

The copter's high-resolution data helps the rover to identify small hazards such as steps and pointy rocks, as well as providing rich textual information useful to predict perception performance. In this paper, we consider a three-agent system composed of a Mars rover, copter, and orbiter. The objective is to provide good localization to the rover by selecting an optimal path that minimizes the localization uncertainty accumulation during the rover's traverse. To achieve this goal, we quantify the localizability as a goodness measure associated with the map, and conduct a joint-space search over rover's path and copter's perceptual actions given prior information from the orbiter. We jointly address where to map by the copter and where to drive by the rover using the proposed iterative copter-rover path planner. We conducted numerical simulations using the map of Mars 2020 landing site to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed planner.\",\n",

Details of the data analysis method and the instrument calibration are presented. Measurements performed on Mars to address geometry effects and background contributions are shown. Cross calibration measurements among several instrument sensors and sources are discussed. An unintentional swap of the two flight instruments is evaluated. New concentration data acquired during the first 470 sols of rover Spirit in Gusev Crater are presented. There are two geological regions, the Gusev plains and the Columbia Hills. The plains contain soils that are very similar to previous landing sites on Mars. A meteoritic component in the soil is identified. Rocks in the plains revealed thin weathering rinds. The underlying abraded rock was classified as primitive basalt. One of these rocks contained significant Br that is probably associated with vein-filling material of different composition. One of the trenches showed large subsurface enrichments of Mg, S, and Br. Disturbed soils and rocks in the Columbia Hills revealed different elemental compositions. These rocks are significantly weathered and enriched in mobile elements, such as P, S, Cl, or Br. Even abraded rock surfaces have high Br concentrations. Thus, in contrast to the rocks and soils in the Gusev Plains, the Columbia Hills material shows more significant evidence of ancient aqueous alteration.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Japanese MMX sample return mission to Phobos by JAXA will carry a rover developed by CNES and DLR that will be deployed on Phobos to perform in situ analysis of the Martian moon's surface properties. Past images of the surface of Phobos show that it is covered by a layer of regolith. However, the mechanical and compositional properties of this regolith are poorly constrained. In particular, from current remote images, very little is known regarding the particle sizes, their chemical composition, the packing density of the regolith as well as other parameters such as friction and cohesion that influence surface dynamics. Understanding the properties and dynamics of the regolith in the low-gravity environment of Phobos is important to trace back its history and surface evolution. Moreover, this information is also important to support the interpretation of data obtained by instruments onboard the main MMX spacecraft, and to minimize the risks involved in the spacecraft sampling operations. The instruments onboard the Rover are a Raman spectrometer (RAX), an infrared radiometer (miniRad), two forward-looking cameras for navigation and science purposes (NavCams), and two cameras observing the interactions of regolith and the rover wheels (WheelCams). The Rover will be deployed before the MMX spacecraft samples Phobos' surface and will be the first rover to drive on the surface of a Martian moon and in a very low gravity environment.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The ChemCam instrument package on the Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity, is the first planetary science instrument to employ laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to determine the compositions of geological samples on another planet. Pre-processing of the spectra involves subtracting the ambient light background, removing noise, removing the electron continuum, calibrating for the wavelength, correcting for the variable distance to the target, and applying a wavelength-dependent correction for the instrument response. Further processing of the data uses multivariate and univariate comparisons with a LIBS spectral library developed prior to launch as well as comparisons with several on-board standards post-landing. The level-2 data products include semi-quantitative abundances derived from partial least squares regression. <P />A LIBS spectral library was developed using 69 rock standards in the form of pressed powder disks, glasses, and ceramics to minimize heterogeneity on the scale of the observation (350-550 μm dia.). The standards covered typical compositional ranges of igneous materials and also included sulfates, carbonates, and phyllosilicates. The provenance and elemental and mineralogical compositions of these standards are described. Spectral characteristics of this data set are presented, including the size distribution and integrated irradiances of the plasmas, and a proxy for plasma temperature as a function of distance from the instrument. Two laboratory-based clones of ChemCam reside in Los Alamos and Toulouse for the purpose of adding new spectra to the database as the need arises. Sensitivity to differences in wavelength correlation to spectral channels and spectral resolution has been investigated, indicating that spectral registration needs to be within half a pixel and resolution needs to match within 1.5 to 2.6 pixels. Absolute errors are tabulated for derived compositions of each major element in each standard using PLS regression. Sources of errors are investigated and discussed, and methods for improving the analytical accuracy of compositions derived from ChemCam spectra are discussed.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Mars Exploration Rover Panoramic Camera (MER/Pancam) instruments have acquired more than 60,000 high-resolution, multispectral, stereoscopic images of soil, rocks, and sky at the Gusev crater and Meridiani Planum landing sites since January 2004. These images, combined with other MER data sets, have enabled new discoveries about the composition, mineralogy, and geologic/geochemical evolution of both sites. One key to the success of Pancam in contributing to the overall success of MER has been the development of a calibration pipeline that can quickly remove instrumental artifacts and generate both absolute radiance and relative reflectance images with high accuracy and precision in order to influence tactical rover driving and in situ sampling decisions. This paper describes in detail the methods, assumptions, and models/algorithms in the calibration pipeline developed for Pancam images, based on new measurements and refinements performed primarily from flight data acquired on Mars. Major calibration steps include modeling and removal of detector bias signal, active and readout region dark current, electronic ``shutter smear,'' and pixel-to-pixel responsivity (flatfield) variations. Pancam images are calibrated to radiance (W/m<SUP>2</SUP>/nm/sr) using refined preflight-derived calibration coefficients, or radiance factor (I/F) using near-in-time measurements of the Pancam calibration target and a model of aeolian dust deposition on the target as a function of time. We are able to verify that the absolute radiance calibration of most Pancam images is accurate to within about 10% or less and that the filter-to-filter and pixel-to-pixel precision of the calibrated relative reflectance data (both based on measurements of the Pancam calibration target) are typically about 3% and 1% or less, respectively. Examples are also presented of scientific applications made possible by the high fidelity of the calibrated Pancam data. These include 11-color visible to near-IR spectral analysis, calculation of ``true color'' and chromaticity values, and generation of ``super resolution'' image data products. This work represents a follow-on and enhancement to the Pancam preflight calibration process described by Bell et al. (2003).\",\n",

After landing in January of 2004, the rovers will use their set of instruments -- the Athena Science Payload -- to test hypotheses for the presence of past water at two separate sites on Mars where conditions may once have been favorable for life. Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing environmental conditions at the time of water activity. The landing sites are being selected on the basis of community-wide study of orbital data collected by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft and other missions. Possibilities include former lakebeds or hydrothermal deposits. The Athena Science Payload includes two mast-mounted remote-sensing instruments: a color stereo imager (Pancam) and a thermal emission infrared point spectrometer (Mini-TES). Mounted on the end of a five degree-of-freedom robotic arm are three more in-situ instruments: an Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer, a Mössbauer Spectrometer, and a Microscopic Imager. A Rock Abrasion Tool is also mounted on the arm, and will be used to remove the surface layers of rocks and expose underlying material for investigation. The rovers are substantially larger than Mars Pathfinder's Sojourner rover. They have substantial onboard autonomy capability, and can traverse many tens of meters per martian day. The combined capabilities of the MER rovers and the Athena payload will make these rovers the first robotic field geologists to operate on another planet.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'first four rocks examined by the Mars Science Laboratory Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer indicate that Curiosity landed in a lithologically diverse region of Mars. These rocks, collectively dubbed the Bradbury assemblage, were studied along an eastward traverse (sols 46-102). Compositions range from Na- and Al-rich mugearite Jake_Matijevic to Fe-, Mg-, and Zn-rich alkali-rich basalt/hawaiite Bathurst_Inlet and span nearly the entire range in FeO* and MnO of the data sets from previous Martian missions and Martian meteorites. The Bradbury assemblage is also enriched in K and moderately volatile metals (Zn and Ge). These elements do not correlate with Cl or S, suggesting that they are associated with the rocks themselves and not with salt-rich coatings. Three out of the four Bradbury rocks plot along a line in elemental variation diagrams, suggesting mixing between Al-rich and Fe-rich components. ChemCam analyses give insight to their degree of chemical heterogeneity and grain size. Variations in trace elements detected by ChemCam suggest chemical weathering (Li) and concentration in mineral phases (e.g., Rb and Sr in feldspars). We interpret the Bradbury assemblage to be broadly volcanic and/or volcaniclastic, derived either from near the Gale crater rim and transported by the Peace Vallis fan network, or from a local volcanic source within Gale Crater. High Fe and Fe/Mn in Et_Then likely reflect secondary precipitation of Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> oxides as a cement or rind. The K-rich signature of the Bradbury assemblage, if igneous in origin, may have formed by small degrees of partial melting of metasomatized mantle.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Mn-oxidizing microorganisms (microbes) on Earth facilitate the formation of manganese oxides, which require high pH and Eh conditions to precipitate. Due to the microbial provenance of Mn oxides, Mn oxides on Mars should be explored for their potential as mineral biosignatures. It is possible to distinguish abiogenic and biogenic Mn-oxides with a suite of analyses on Earth. However, rover payload instruments are limited, and using these instruments to test the biogenicity of Mn oxides has not been assessed. As one of the goals of the Perseverance and Rosalind Franklin rover missions is to identify samples containing potential biosignatures (evidence of life recorded in the rock record), it is important to identify the biosignatures that would be detectable with the rover payloads. <P />Trace element (TE) data were collected from three New Mexico Mn oxide samples with ICP-MS bulk dissolution analysis. Sample MCA is banded Mn-oxide and calcite from the hydrothermal deposit at MCA mine (Socorro County, NM), and is likely abiotic due to the high temperatures experienced by this paleo-hydrothermal environment. TC is a stromatolitic manganese mineralization from the Ellis Mn deposit (T or C, NM), presumed to be biotic because of the unusual \"cauliflower-like\" textures of the ores. TM is from Tortugas Mountain and is banded Mn-oxide and calcite from a geothermal spring edifice (Dona Ana County, NM), which is likely biotic based on morphologic characteristics similar to the Ellis Mn ores. These samples were compared with two biotic deep-sea Mn nodules (Nod-P and Nod-A). Initial TE data indicate that TC is biotic, while MCA and TM are abiotic. TC and both Mn nodules have higher Mn than Ca, while MCA and TM have more Ca. The nodules and TC also have higher amounts of Ti and Ni than MCA and TM. TC is also elevated in Ba relative to the other samples and the nodules. This data supports the expected biogenicity of TC and abiogenicity of MCA but contradicts the expected biogenicity of TM. On-going analyses with laser ablation (LA) ICP-MS are being conducted to determine how well microscale analyses of these Mn oxides represent the whole sample. Because laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy is available on Mars rover missions, it is important to understand how TE abundance and trends can be linked to biogenicity with laser-based space flight instruments.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The selection of Gale crater as the Mars Science Laboratory landing site took over five years, involved broad participation of the science community via five open workshops, and narrowed an initial &gt;50 sites (25 by 20 km) to four finalists (Eberswalde, Gale, Holden and Mawrth) based on science and safety. Engineering constraints important to the selection included: (1) latitude (±30°) for thermal management of the rover and instruments, (2) elevation (&lt;-1 km) for sufficient atmosphere to slow the spacecraft, (3) relief of &lt;100-130 m at baselines of 1-1000 m for control authority and sufficient fuel during powered descent, (4) slopes of &lt;30° at baselines of 2-5 m for rover stability at touchdown, (5) moderate rock abundance to avoid impacting the belly pan during touchdown, and (6) a radar-reflective, load-bearing, and trafficable surface that is safe for landing and roving and not dominated by fine-grained dust. Science criteria important for the selection include the ability to assess past habitable environments, which include diversity, context, and biosignature (including organics) preservation. Sites were evaluated in detail using targeted data from instruments on all active orbiters, and especially Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. All of the final four sites have layered sedimentary rocks with spectral evidence for phyllosilicates that clearly address the science objectives of the mission. Sophisticated entry, descent and landing simulations that include detailed information on all of the engineering constraints indicate all of the final four sites are safe for landing. Evaluation of the traversabilty of the landing sites and target \"go to\" areas outside of the ellipse using slope and material properties information indicates that all are trafficable and \"go to\" sites can be accessed within the lifetime of the mission. In the final selection, Gale crater was favored over Eberswalde based on its greater diversity and potential habitability.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Mars' magnetic field has been measured at large scale by orbiting spacecraft and at very small scale via Martian meteorites. Here we report on a ground magnetic survey on metre to kilometre scales. The Zhurong rover made vector measurements at 16 sites along a 1,089 m track in the Utopia Basin on Mars. It recorded an extremely weak magnetic field, with an order of the average intensity less than that inferred from orbit, in contrast to the large magnetic field in Elysium Planitia measured by InSight. A spacecraft measurement samples an area with radius comparable to its altitude, while a ground measurement samples an area with radius comparable to the depth of the magnetized body. The weak magnetic field measured by Zhurong indicates no magnetization anomalies for a depth of many kilometres around and below the rover's traverse. We suggest two possible explanations for the weak magnetic field: the entire Utopia Basin may have remained unmagnetized since its formation about 4 billion years ago or that the 5-km-radius ghost crater where Zhurong landed may have been been demagnetized by impact.\",\n",

Novel entry, descent, and landing approaches will be used to accurately deliver the 900-kg rover, including the ability to sense and \"fly out\" deviations from a best-estimate atmospheric state. A joint engineering and science team developed methods to estimate the range of potential atmospheric states at the time of arrival and to quantitatively assess the spacecraft\\'s performance and risk given its particular sensitivities to atmospheric conditions. Numerical models are used to calculate the atmospheric parameters, with observations used to define model cases, tune model parameters, and validate results. This joint program has resulted in a spacecraft capable of accessing, with minimal risk, the four finalist sites chosen for their scientific merit. The capability to operate the landed rover over the latitude range of candidate landing sites, and for all seasons, was verified against an analysis of surface environmental conditions described here. These results, from orbital and model data sets, also drive engineering simulations of the rover\\'s thermal state that are used to plan surface operations.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Manifested for flight on NASA\\'s 2020 Mars Rover, the Mars Oxygen In Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) is a 1% scale model of an oxygen processing plant that is intended to support a human expedition sometime in the 2030s. Like the \"Oxygenator\" in Andy Weir\\'s \"The Martian,\" MOXIE ingests the thin CO _{2} that comprises 96% of the Martian air, and produces O _{2} and CO as products. Such a process would produce 30 metric tons of liquid oxygen (LOx) for ascent vehicle propellant in the 16 months preceding launch of a human crew to Mars, representing 78% of the propellant mass needed for a CH _{4}/O _{2} propulsion system. To bring this amount of oxygen from Earth would otherwise require 4 to 5 heavy lift launches [1]. At Caltech\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory the MOXIE Project is now assembling and testing flight hardware. In the MOXIE enclosure, a scroll pump developed by Air Squared, Inc. collects and compresses the CO _{2} for conversion to O _{2} by MOXIE\\'s solid oxide electrolysis (SOXE) stack, which is built by Ceramatec, Inc. [2]. The stack is constructed from scandia-stabilized zirconia electrolyte-supported cells with thin screen-printed electrodes, coated with a catalytic cathode on one side and an anode on the other. When CO _{2} flows over the catalyzed cathode surface at 800°C under an applied electric potential, it is electrolyzed to produce CO and oxygen ions. The ions are electrochemically drawn through the solid oxide electrolyte to the anode, where they combine to produce gaseous O _{2}. On Mars, MOXIE will generate a minimum of 6 g/hr high purity oxygen from the Martian atmosphere in at least 15 separate runs, sampling different environmental conditions on Mars, in the 2.5 years following landing of the Mars 2020 rover in February, 2021 [3]. Oxygen production is expected to be limited both by the compressor capacity and by the external conditions that determine the density and quantity of air that can be drawn in. While MOXIE stands on its own as a means to perform the specific function of fueling an ascent vehicle, it is also an exemplar of the direction in situ resource utilization (ISRU) is likely to take in the exploration of a new world. On Earth, the single most important resource is sunlight, the ultimate source of all the energy to support life. Arguably, our atmosphere is the second most significant, followed by water. While the air serves many mechanical functions, from windmills to the expansion medium in hot air balloons, its most important role is as a source of oxygen, an oxidant for chemical reactions that include our own metabolical respiration. Instead of oxygen, Mars offers us carbon dioxide as an oxidant. MOXIE takes a decidedly Earth-centric view of this resource, using it as a source of the more familiar O _{2} and either discarding the CO as an unwanted byproduct or using it as a feedstock to produce methane fuel in combination with a to-be-determined source of hydrogen. In a Mars-centric viewpoint, we might instead consider burning the CO and O _{2} byproducts directly, closing the cycle by producing CO _{2}. We might also consider bypassing oxygen production entirely and directly using CO _{2} as an oxidant with lithium or other reactive metals.[1] Drake B. ed. (2007).

       "    'abstract': 'Previous and current Mars rover missions have noted a nearly ubiquitous presence of duricrusts on the planet surface. Duricrusts are thin, brittle layers of cemented regolith that cover the underlying terrain. In some cases, the duricrust hides safe or relatively safe underneath the top soil. However, as was observed by both Mars exploration rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, such crusts can also hide loose, untrafficable terrain, leading to Spirit becoming permanently incapacitated in 2009. Whilst several reports of the Martian surface have indicated the presence of duricrusts, none have been able to provide details on the physical properties of the material, which may indicate the level of safe traversability of duricrust terrains. This paper presents the findings of testing terrestrially-created duricrusts with simulated Martian soil properties, in order to determine the properties of such duricrusts and to discover what level of hazard that they may represent (e.g. can vehicles traverse the duricrust surface without penetration to lower sub-surface soils?). Combinations of elements that have been observed in the Martian soil were used as the basis for forming the laboratory-created duricrusts. Variations in duricrust thickness, water content, and the iron oxide compound were investigated. As was observed throughout the testing process, duricrusts behave in a rather brittle fashion and are easily destroyed by low surface pressures. This indicates that duricrusts are not safe for traversing and they present a definite hazard for travelling on the Martian landscape when utilising only visual terrain classification, as the surface appearance is not necessarily representative of what may be lying beneath.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The history of planetary rovers in the U.S. space program is outlined in the context of the goals, mission and spacecraft designs, and operations designs. The American lunar rover work has had three main stages. In the early sixties, the capacity of Surveyor lunar landers to deliver rovers with a mass of about 50 kg to the Moon was exploited. Several such machines were built and tested beginning in 1964 but none went to the Moon. A manned 400 kg short range rover was then developed. Three of these operated on the Moon in 1971 and 1972 as part of the Apollo 15, 16 and 17 missions. Following these Apollo successes, attempts were made to provide two kinds of follow on models: automated or dual mode (human carrying or not) rovers in the few hundred kg size class, and multi-ton mobile habitats that could carry humans on extended traverses. With the closing of both Soviet and American lunar exploration in the seventies, neither of these proposals succeeded. In parallel with these lunar developments, a lengthy technology program on Martian roving has gone on in the U.S., sometimes coming close to preproject status and sometimes fading away, but never quite being abandoned. As a result it is possible today to contemplate a wide range of lunar and Martian roving missions that could be made practical within a few years. However, with today's funding constraints none of the well studied, larger mission concepts appear to fit. Therefore new efforts are being made toward developing much smaller rovers taking advantage of new miniature techniques, not only in mobility systems but also in the scientific instruments that a small rover can carry. Illustrations are included.\",\n",

RIMFAX will add a new dimension to rover investigations of Mars by providing the capability to image the shallow subsurface beneath the rover. The principal goals of the RIMFAX investigation are to image subsurface structure, and to provide information regarding subsurface composition. Data provided by RIMFAX will aid Perseverance's mission to explore the ancient habitability of its field area and to select a set of promising geologic samples for analysis, caching, and eventual return to Earth. RIMFAX is a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, which transmits a signal swept through a range of frequencies, rather than a single wide-band pulse. The operating frequency range of 150-1200 MHz covers the typical frequencies of GPR used in geology. In general, the full bandwidth (with effective center frequency of 675 MHz) will be used for shallow imaging down to several meters, and a reduced bandwidth of the lower frequencies (center frequency 375 MHz) will be used for imaging deeper structures. The majority of data will be collected at regular distance intervals whenever the rover is driving, in each of the deep, shallow, and surface modes. Stationary measurements with extended integration times will improve depth range and SNR at select locations. The RIMFAX instrument consists of an electronic unit housed inside the rover body and an antenna mounted externally at the rear of the rover. Several instrument prototypes have been field tested in different geological settings, including glaciers, permafrost sediments, bioherme mound structures in limestone, and sedimentary features in sand dunes. Numerical modelling has provided a first assessment of RIMFAX's imaging potential using parameters simulated for the Jezero crater landing site.\",\n",

A full diurnal cycle at four different seasons (Ls 0, 90, 180 and 270) is investigated at the Curiosity rover location (Gale crater) and at the InSight location (Elysium Planitia). We examine the atmospheric pressure, ground and air temperatures and relative humidity obtained by REMS on its journey from the Curiosity rover landing site to its current position on the slopes of Mount Sharp, studying the evolution of the meteorology during the rover's traverse when comparing to MRAMS. The results help to better understand the meteorology inside Gale <P />Crater, revealing changes in pressure and temperature driven by the change in altitude of the rover and meteorological cycles, and confirming the hypothesis about the existence of a pocket of cold air at the bottom of the crater. Air temperature and wind speed and direction data obtained from TWINS, atmospheric pressure from Pressure Sensor (PS) and ground temperature from HP3 radiometer (RAD) all of them onboard the InSight lander are compared to data from MRAMS. We also use a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to study the mechanical contamination of the wind directions due to other instruments onboard InSight lander and it effect into the wind directions discrepancy between modeling and observations for low wind speeds. MRAMS model results are shown to be in good agreement with observations when considering the uncertainties in the observational data set. The good agreement provides justification for utilizing the model results to investigate the broader meteorological environment of missions' locations.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Introduction In order to study unaltered rocks, Mars rovers are equipped with abrasive and/or drilling devices. NASA\\'s Spirit and Opportunity rovers were equipped with a Rock Abrasion Tool to remove the first mm of altered material [1]. NASA\\'s Curiosity and Perseverance and ESA\\'s Rosalind Franklin ExoMars rovers are equipped with drilling device to collect samples for in situ analysis and, for Perseverance, in preparation for a future Mars Sample Return mission [2-4]. During these drilling phases, a pile of rock powder, of varying size depending on the drilling depth, forms at the surface.The objective of the ExoMars mission will be to search for past or extant biosignatures for which drill-cores will be collected from up to 2 meters deep; the depth at which organic matter is preserved from degrading UV and particle irradiation. The drill has a diameter of 3 cm. The cone of powder at the surface could thus represent more than 1.5 dm3, a relatively large quantity of material which will not be analysed by the instruments inside the rover but which could be observed by the CLUPI and PanCam cameras [4-6].Powder can be considered as a textureless material when the grain size is lower than the spatial resolution of the photograph, which is the case for rocks drilled on Mars as observed by MSL [2]. Colour is then the only measurable data; however, this apparent colour is totally dependent on ambient light and on the camera itself. In order to solve this problem, we have developed a new method called CaliPhoto, for which a reference plate is added to the camera\\'s field of view and then image processing is used to compensate for camera characteristics and lighting conditions [7,8]. The images thus obtained can then be compared with each other or with a reference database. Here, we used a series of analogue rocks to demonstrate the ability of the method to identify volcanic rock powders on Mars. Materials and methods The majority of rocks on the surface of Mars are volcanic [9,10] thus, for this study, 23 relevant samples were selected from the Massif Central, in France, in order to cover a large range of volcanic rock types, as designated in the compositional TAS diagram (Total Alkali Silica). The samples were then crushed and each powder was placed in the centre of the CaliPhoto reference plate and photographed. The CaliPhoto image processing was then used to \"calibrate\" the photographs and a database was created (see Fig. 1).Figure 1: Images of the volcanic rock samples after CaliPhoto image processing. Results and discussion Different tests were carried out [8]. First, each sample was photographed twice in different lighting conditions, the first image was imported into the database and the second was used to test the identification procedure. For 50% of powders, the identification is exact, i.e., the studied powder corresponds to the highest matching identification from the database, in 77% of cases, the studied powder is in the top two matches, and in 95% of cases, it is in the top three. Moreover, when the studied powder is not in the first position, the best match occurs for a rock of similar or close composition.The analogue rock ESA-01-E (picrobasalt), chosen by ESA for its physical and chemical similarities to known Martian rocks, was then used to test the ability of the method to evaluate the composition of a powder that is not in the database. The method successfully identified the sample as a picrobasalt.The rocks were crushed at 4 different grain sizes in order to evaluate the effect of grain size distribution on the method. Indeed, the apparent luminosity of powder is known to increase with decreasing grain size. For 32% of the powders the identification is exact, i.e., the studied powder corresponds to the highest matching value. Moreover, for 91% of cases, a rock with a similar or adjacent composition as defined by the TAS diagram is in the top three matches, even when the powder is not in the database.Finally, by coupling hand sample and powder colour vectors, the identification is exact for 68% of rocks and the studied sample is in the top three matches in 100% of cases. Moreover, when the studied sample is only in the second or third position, the difference with the best match is always lower than 1%. Conclusion and perspectives The CaliPhoto method could be very useful on Mars to help identify rocks during drilling without adding any new instrumentation except a specific colour plate that could be positioned near the powders. Unfortunately, Mars rovers are not equipped with such a plate. Thus we proposed to use the calibration targets present on the rovers to calibrate the colour of the martian floor before drilling then to use it as reference for the CaliPhoto method. The first tests were relatively conclusive.Finally, with the postponement of the mission, the CaliPhoto colour plate could constitute a good complement to the ExoMars rover.

It is the result of a collaboration between ISAE-SUPAERO, IRAP and LANL, under the supervision of CNES. The Mars microphone will be located on the mast of the Mars 2020 rover, close to the SuperCam laser head. It has several scientific objectives. Its primary goal is to support the Laser LIBS investigation to enhance its capability of determining properties of Mars rocks and soils through their coupling with the laser beam. In addition, it will contribute to basic atmospheric science, by providing wind speed statistics, convective vortices, dust devil studies at close distance or when interacting with the rover. Finally it will record the unique signature of many artificial sounds: operations of the robotic arm and mast, sounds of the wheels on the ground when driving and other noise coming from the rover. In order to satisfy its requirements, the Mars Microphone is able to record audio signals from 100 Hz to 10 kHz on the surface of Mars, with a sensitivity sufficient to monitor a LIBS impact at distances up to 4 m. To meet these requirements, a condenser microphone has been selected and the amplification gains and dynamics of the instrument have been carefully chosen. The microphone has passed its qualification and performance tests, including end-to-end tests in Martian environment, and has been delivered to IRAP for integration on the SuperCam instrument. The delivery of the Supercam instrument (and therefore of the Mars microphone) to the Jet Propulsion laboratory is expected at the end of 2018.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"ESA's renewed Rosalind Franklin Mission (RFM) is scheduled for launch to Mars in 2028 and will address one of the most important scientific objectives of our time: to search for signs of life. An advanced state of science and operations readiness was achieved for the 2022 launch opportunity, prior to cessation of ESA's collaboration with Roscosmos. Now, the reconfigured and renewed Rosalind Franklin Mission entails development of a new European lander for delivery of Rosalind Franklin to Mars, and includes contribution of a launcher and other elements by NASA. The landing site remains Oxia Planum and the revised mission timeline provides great opportunity for further detailed study of the site, by interpretation of orbital data, analogue lab- and field-work, and numerical simulations. The ExoMars Rover Science Operations Working Group (RSOWG), chartered in 2019, continues at a sustainable pace to address specific needs serving to advance science readiness. The 'Micro' sub-group address topics regarding the spatial scale of the samples that will be extracted from down to 2m by the rover's drill, their analogues, and plans for their analyses. Ongoing work regards a set of 'Mission Reference Samples' – a suite of analogue samples most relevant to the landing site and mission objectives, which are under characterization by ground models of the MicrOmega, RLS and MOMA instruments. Members of the 'Macro' sub-group continue geological interpretation of the landing site, and hold plans to refocus on the revised 2028 landing ellipse pattern. Meanwhile, dedicated efforts are underway to maintain and revise as needed systems at the Rover Operations Control Centre (ROCC - Turin, Italy). A continued plan of testing and simulations is planned in the interim years at ROCC, providing opportunities to exercise Science and Control Team processes. Finally, a special Science Knowledge Management Programme has been set up to support key expertise within the science and instrument teams, such that the valuable team knowledge and experience that has been already built may be retained and developed. We report on the new Rosalind Franklin Mission scenario, and the science team activities that are both currently ongoing, and planned in the coming years, towards ramp-up to operational readiness for a 2028 launch.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"As a 11<SUP>th</SUP> and 12<SUP>th</SUP> grade Astrobiology class we were charged with developing a scientific research question about the potential for life on Mars. We narrowed our big picture question to, 'Where should the next Mars rover land in order to study the volcanic and water features to find evidence of past or present extremophiles on Mars?'After a lot of searching through images on JMARS (although not extensive due to high school time constraints) we narrowed our interest to three areas of Mars we thought could be good candidates to land a rover there to do further research. We know from extremophiles on Earth that microscopic life need water and energy. It seems reasonable that Mars would be no different. We developed a research question, 'Does Kasei Valles, Dzigai Vallis and Hecate Tholus have volcanic features (lava flow, fractures, volcanoes, cryovolcanoes) and water features (layers of ice, hematite, carbonate, chaos)?'This question is important and interesting because by having a deeper understanding of whether these places have evidence of volcanic and water features, we will be able to decide where the best place to land a future rover would be. Evidence of volcanic and water features are important to help determine where to land our rover because in those areas, temperatures could have been warm and the land could be wet. In these conditions, the probability of life is higher.We individually did research through JMARS (CTX, THEMIS) in order to establish if those three areas could contain certain land features (volcanic and water features) that could possibly lead to the discovery of extremophiles. We evaluated the images to determine if the three areas have evidence of those volcanic and water features.Although we are not experts at identifying features we believe we have evidence to say that all three areas are interesting, astrobiologically, but Dzigai Vallis shows the most number of types of volcanic and water features. More importantly, through this process we as a class began to understand true authentic science and how it is performed.Thank you to Arizona State University for the curriculum and guidance.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Due to the potential for extant biological activity on Mars, mission architectures for Mars Sample Return (MSR) must demonstrate robust containment and rigorous control of all unsterilized materials to protect the Earth\\'s biosphere. The launch of NASA\\'s drilling and caching Mars rover in summer 2020 is the first step in the MSR campaign to bring carefully collected and sealed samples of Mars to Earth for scientific study. Subsequently, NASA, ESA, and others will work together to load Mars 2020-collected samples into a sample container on the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The sample container will be sealed, launched, and released by the MAV into Mars orbit where the waiting Earth Return Orbiter will capture the it and further seal it in a containment canister. The \"chain of contact\" between Mars and Earth will be broken by the use of various combinations of sterilization and dust mitigation to remove potential biological contaminants. Minimizing the area of surfaces exposed to martian dust and performing one or more sterilization procedures are key options for compliance with backward planetary protection prior to departure from Mars orbit, and the samples will return to Earth inside of a highly robust Earth Return Vehicle. Once landed on Earth, inspection followed by additional cleaning and biobarrier deployment will ensure safe handling during transport to a state-of-the-art receiving facility that will support sample-handling procedures similar to BSL-4. NASA and ESA are working in coordination with COSPAR to engage disciplinary experts across academic, regulatory, and industrial organizations to discuss current technologies for life detection and sterilization/ inactivation, and the comprehensive development of safety protocols for handling and studying Mars materials on Earth.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Onboard data analysis techniques have allowed for increased science productivity on Earth orbiters and Mars rovers, but autonomous capabilities have yet to be demonstrated for outer Solar System missions. The Europa Clipper mission presents such an opportunity for the use of onboard science analysis to mitigate limitations stemming from high latency and downlink constraints. Europa Clipper will make ~40 flybys of Europa - not all of the data collected can be returned. Here we explore the feasibility of coordinated observations by multiple instruments to maximize science return and increase the possibility of capturing rare or transient events, such as hot spots or plumes. For example, low-resolution survey observations collected by the Europa Thermal Emission Imaging System (E-THEMIS) can inform the prioritization of high-volume observations by the Mapping Imaging Spectrometer for Europa (MISE), providing detailed compositional information of a potential hot spot. Analyzing data collected by one instrument may also be used to serve as a trigger for other instruments to begin observations. The Europa Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) will be able to detect small plumes; if a plume is detected, E-THEMIS, MISE, or the Europa Imaging System (EIS) could turn on to try to \"see\" the source. Finally, onboard science analysis may assist in selecting data collection modes. The Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS) employs operational modes with different parameters for magnetospheric versus ionospheric observations. Onboard analysis of the data as it is collected may inform the decision about when to switch between ionospheric and magnetic observation modes. Further development of onboard data prioritization and instrument coordination scenarios will not only increase science return for Clipper, but will pave the way for autonomous coordinated science on future missions to other remote locations, such as Titan and Enceladus.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) on board the two Mars Exploration Rovers provides the first opportunity to observe thermal properties from the Martian surface, relate these properties to orbital data, and perform soil conductivity experiments under Martian conditions. The thermal inertias of soils, bedforms, and rock at each landing site were derived to quantify the physical properties of these features and understand geologic processes occurring at these localities. The thermal inertia for the Gusev plains rock target Bonneville Beacon (~1200 J m<SUP>-2</SUP> K<SUP>-1</SUP> s<SUP>-1/2</SUP>) is consistent with a dense, basaltic rock, but the rocks at the Columbia Hills have a lower thermal inertia (~620 J m<SUP>-2</SUP> K<SUP>-1</SUP> s<SUP>-1/2</SUP>), suggesting that they have a volcaniclasic origin. Bedforms on the floors of craters at both landing sites have thermal inertias of 200 J m<SUP>-2</SUP> K<SUP>-1</SUP> s<SUP>-1/2</SUP>, consistent with a particle diameter of ~160 μm. This diameter is comparable to the most easily moved grain size in the current atmosphere on Mars, suggesting that these bedforms may have formed under current atmospheric conditions. Along the Meridiani plains, the thermal inertia is lower than that derived from TES and Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) orbital data. This discrepancy is not well understood. Mini-TES-derived thermal inertias at Gusev along a ~2.5 km traverse follow trends in thermal inertia measured from orbit with TES and THEMIS. However, along the traverse, there are variability and mixing of particle sizes that are not resolved in the orbital thermal inertia data due to meter-scale processes that are not identifiable at larger scales.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Spirit landed on the floor of Gusev Crater and conducted initial operations on soil-covered, rock-strewn cratered plains underlain by olivine-bearing basalts. Plains surface rocks are covered by wind-blown dust and show evidence for surface enrichment of soluble species as vein and void-filling materials and coatings. The surface enrichment is the result of a minor amount of transport and deposition by aqueous processes. Layered granular deposits were discovered in the Columbia Hills, with outcrops that tend to dip conformably with the topography. The granular rocks are interpreted to be volcanic ash and/or impact ejecta deposits that have been modified by aqueous fluids during and/or after emplacement. Soils consist of basaltic deposits that are weakly cohesive, relatively poorly sorted, and covered by a veneer of wind-blown dust. The soils have been homogenized by wind transport over at least the several kilometer length scale traversed by the rover. Mobilization of soluble species has occurred within at least two soil deposits examined. The presence of monolayers of coarse sand on wind-blown bedforms, together with even spacing of granule-sized surface clasts, suggests that some of the soil surfaces encountered by Spirit have not been modified by wind for some time. On the other hand, dust deposits on the surface and rover deck have changed during the course of the mission. Detection of dust devils, monitoring of the dust opacity and lower boundary layer, and coordinated experiments with orbiters provided new insights into atmosphere-surface dynamics.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) will provide remote measurements of mineralogy and thermophysical properties of the scene surrounding the Mars Exploration Rovers and guide the rovers to key targets for detailed in situ measurements by other rover experiments. The specific scientific objectives of the Mini-TES investigation are to (1) determine the mineralogy of rocks and soils, (2) determine the thermophysical properties of selected soil patches, and (3) determine the temperature profile, dust and water-ice opacity, and water vapor abundance in the lower atmospheric boundary layer. The Mini-TES is a Fourier Transform Spectrometer covering the spectral range 5-29 μm (339.50 to 1997.06 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>) with a spectral sample interval of 9.99 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The Mini-TES telescope is a 6.35-cm-diameter Cassegrain telescope that feeds a flat-plate Michelson moving mirror mounted on a voice-coil motor assembly. A single deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) uncooled pyroelectric detector with proven space heritage gives a spatial resolution of 20 mrad; an actuated field stop can reduce the field of view to 8 mrad. Mini-TES is mounted within the rover's Warm Electronics Box and views the terrain using its internal telescope looking up the hollow shaft of the Pancam Mast Assembly (PMA) to the fixed fold mirror and rotating elevation scan mirror in the PMA head located ~1.5 m above the ground. The PMA provides a full 360°of azimuth travel and views from 30° above the nominal horizon to 50° below. An interferogram is collected every two seconds and transmitted to the Rover computer, where the Fast Fourier Transform, spectral summing, lossless compression, and data formatting are performed prior to transmission to Earth. Radiometric calibration is provided by two calibration V-groove blackbody targets instrumented with platinum thermistor temperature sensors with absolute temperature calibration of +/-0.1°C. One calibration target is located inside the PMA head; the second is on the Rover deck. The Mini-TES temperature is expected to vary diurnally from -10 to +30°C, with most surface composition data collected at scene temperatures &gt;270 K. For these conditions the radiometric precision for two-spectra summing is +/-1.8 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> W cm<SUP>-2</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP>/cm<SUP>-1</SUP> between 450 and 1500 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>, increasing to ~4.2 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> W cm<SUP>-2</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP>/cm<SUP>-1</SUP> at shorter (300 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>) and longer (1800 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>) wave numbers. The absolute radiance error will be &lt;5 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> W cm<SUP>-2</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP>/cm<SUP>-1</SUP>, decreasing to ~1 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> W cm<SUP>-2</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP>/cm<SUP>-1</SUP> over the wave number range where the scene temperature will be determined (1200-1600 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>). The worst-case sum of these random and systematic radiance errors corresponds to an absolute temperature error of ~0.4 K for a true surface temperature of 270 K and ~1.5 K for a surface at 180 K. The Mini-TES will be operated in a 20-mrad panorama mode and an 8-mrad targeted mode, producing two-dimensional rasters and three-dimensional hyperspectral image cubes of varying sizes. The overall Mini-TES envelope size is 23.5 × 16.3 × 15.5 cm, and the mass is 2.40 kg. The power consumption is 5.6 W average. The Mini-TES was developed by Arizona State University and Raytheon Santa Barbara Remote Sensing.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Mars Helicopter is a technology demonstration to be carried on the Mars 2020 Rover and will be the first aerial vehicle on another planet. It is a free flying, solar powered, ~1.8 kg coaxial spacecraft with counter rotating blades about 1.2 m long that can fly in the thin martian atmosphere. It carries a central computer, an inertial measurement unit, laser altimeter, inclinometer, accelerometers, and gyros, all of which are enclosed in an insulated and heated fuselage. The helicopter also carries two cameras: a panchromatic, wide angle 0.3 megapixel navigation camera that is nadir pointing to track the position of the helicopter, and a 13 megapixel color camera that captures the surface from near nadir to just above the horizon. Prior to flight, the helicopter rides along on the underside of the rover in a folded configuration. Upon selection of a suitable deployment site by ground operators (using images acquired by the rover), the helicopter is deployed onto smooth, flat, rock-free terrain. After the helicopter unfolds into an operational configuration, the rover will drive a safe distance away (within line of sight) and image the helicopter. During flight, the helicopter will communicate with the rover and image the surface. Stereo images can be acquired via motion of the helicopter. Images acquired immediately prior to landing are used by ground operators to localize the helicopter relative to the terrain for future flights. Data acquired during flight are stored in helicopter non-volatile memory and are later transferred to the rover during post-flight communications (expected to be at night) and later relayed to Earth by the rover. The helicopter battery is charged by a solar panel for several sols before the next flight. Images from the helicopter can be georeferenced to maps of the landing site composed of both high-resolution orbital images and surface rover images to reconstruct the flight path. Helicopter images also provide a unique aerial view of the landscape that is intermediate in resolution between orbital and rover images, for study of surface geology and geomorphology.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"An important and perhaps dominant source of dust in the Martian atmosphere, dust devils play a key role in Mars' climate. Data sets from previous landed missions have revealed dust devil activity, constrained their structures, and elucidated their dust-lifting capacities. However, each landing site and observational season exhibits unique meteorological properties that shape dust devil activity and illuminate their dependence on ambient conditions. The recent release of data from the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA) instrument suite on board the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover promises a new treasure trove for dust devil studies. In this study, we sift the time series from MEDA's Pressure Sensor (PS) and Radiative and Dust Sensors (RDS) to look for the signals of passing vortices and dust devils. We detected 309 vortex encounters over the mission's first 89 sols. Consistent with predictions, these encounter rates exceed InSight and Curiosity's encounter rates. The RDS time series also allows us to assess whether a passing vortex is likely to be dusty (and therefore is a true dust devil) or dustless. We find that about one quarter of vortices show signs of dust lofting, although unfavorable encounter geometries may have prevented us from detecting dust for other vortices. In addition to these results, we discuss prospects for vortex studies as additional data from Mars 2020 are processed and made available.\",\n",

This hyperarid region has significant similarities to the Martian heavily eroded mid-latitude cratered terrains in terms of crater density, size, and geomorphology. Profiles across small-buried craters revealed a coherent sequence of tilted layers constituting the cratonic infill resulting from aeolian deposits. In the intercrater areas the radargram revealed a poorly-defined subsurface stratigraphy and the presence of shallow structural elements associated with potential evidences of the consequences of the shock effects, i.e., faulting, fractures, and chaotic bedrock. The radar-penetration depth varied from 2 to 15 m, depending mainly on the amplitude of the volume and multiple scattering in the subsurface, caused by fractures and debris created by the impacts. We conclude that mid-frequency GPR onboard future Martian rovers can successfully perform similar structural mapping.',\n",

For example, study the pictures of Earth floating above Jupiter's Great Red Spot and the asteroid Itokawa resting beside Toronto's CN Tower.

The Martian twilight can be imaged more than 2 hours after the sun has set due to forward scattering of sunlight by atmospheric dust. That scattering must start high in the atmosphere, as \"noctilucent” dust regions. Thus, the fall-off of brightness with time is somewhat diagnostic of the vertical distribution of dust over several scale heights from the surface. Closer to, and shortly before, sunset, the atmospheric imaging becomes increasingly sensitive to low-altitude dust. Analysis of sky images as the Sun sets shows that brightness is sensitive to dust variations in and around the boundary layer. Specifically, our proof-of-concept data set is modeled with a factor of several dust concentration discontinuity around 10 km altitude at each site. The sense of the discontinuity is opposite at the two sites, with more dust in the boundary layer at the dusty Gusev site and more dust in the free atmosphere above the Meridiani site. <P />This work was supported by the NASA Mars Exploration Project Participating Scientist Program.',\n",

Results from imaging data from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) and Context Camera (CTX) confirm geomorphic evidence for fluvial activity and may indicate an early lacustrine phase. Analysis of spectral data from the CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) instrument shows clay-bearing units interstratified with sulfate-bearing strata in the lower member of the layered mound, again indicative of aqueous activity. The formation age of the layered mound, derived from crater counts and superposition relationships, is ∼3.6-3.8 Ga and straddles the Noachian-Hesperian time-stratigraphic boundary.

Data from the Curiosity Rover suggests a background methane concentration of a few tenths parts per billion whereas data from the Trace Gas Orbiter suggest an upper limit of twenty parts per trillion. If methane exists on Mars then we do not understand fully the physical and chemical processes affecting its lifetime. Atmospheric models suggest an over-estimate in the lifetime by a factor of around six hundred compared with earlier observations. In the present work we assume the Curiosity Rover background methane value and estimate the uncertainty in atmospheric chemistry and mixing processes in our atmospheric column model 1D TERRA. Results suggest that these processes can only explain a factor of ~sixteen lowering in the methane lifetime. This implies that if methane is present then additional, currently unknown processes are required to explain the observed lifetime.',\n",

In particular, the unique subsurface drill will address some of these, such as the possible existence and stability of subsurface organics. PanCam will establish the surface geological and morphological context for the mission, working in collaboration with other context instruments. Here, we describe the PanCam scientific objectives in geology, atmospheric science, and 3-D vision. We discuss the design of PanCam, which includes a stereo pair of Wide Angle Cameras (WACs), each of which has an 11-position filter wheel and a High Resolution Camera (HRC) for high-resolution investigations of rock texture at a distance. The cameras and electronics are housed in an optical bench that provides the mechanical interface to the rover mast and a planetary protection barrier. The electronic interface is via the PanCam Interface Unit (PIU), and power conditioning is via a DC-DC converter. PanCam also includes a calibration target mounted on the rover deck for radiometric calibration, fiducial markers for geometric calibration, and a rover inspection mirror.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity investigated the physical properties of Martian regolith in 7 wheel trenches and 20 wheel scuffs distributed along traverses at Gusev crater and Meridiani Planum. Specialized wheel-trenching sequences allowed analysis of wheel motor and suspension telemetry to determine regolith friction angle $\\\\phi$ and cohesion c at trench sites. Friction angles were 30°-37°, and cohesions were 0-2 kPa. Simpler wheel-scuff maneuvers were analyzed for cohesion by assuming the range of $\\\\phi$ determined from trenches; cohesions in wheel-scuffed regoliths were from 0 to 11 kPa. Regolith $\\\\phi$ and c can be related to regolith origins. Grain sorting, compaction, shape, size, and angularity influence $\\\\phi$. Impact cratering and aeolian processes have affected grain angularity and sorting of Martian regolith at both Mars Exploration Rover (MER) landing sites and contend in opposing ways to determine grain characteristics in the regolith. Friction angles are consistent with dry, rigid, nonplaty grains with particle size frequencies dominated by very fine sand (as seen by the Microscopic Imager or MI) with at least some grain rounding (unresolved by MI), reflecting physical weathering from aeolian saltation. Friction angle results from MER trenches therefore indicate that regolith states are between fully mature aeolian materials and impact debris. MI and color Pancam views show trench tailings and trench floors are redder, brighter, and have more intermixed extremely fine (unresolved) grains than regolith closer to the surface disturbed and exposed only by rolling tracks.',\n",

In addition to the sampling experiments, the mission will include instruments capable of characterizing the local context of the samples at geological time scales, studying the current environment, and demonstrating oxygen generation from the Martian atmosphere (MOXIE), an important human exploration goal. The Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA) was selected as part of the Mars 2020 payload, in particular, to address future human exploration objectives, including characterization of dust size and morphology and understanding surface weather. In addition to its scientific importance, dust sizes and shapes are critical for proper design of in-situ resource elements such as filters for a MOXIE-type experiment. MEDA comprises a suite of sensors that will measure dust particle size distribution and phase function to attain particle shape, optical depth, surface pressure, air and surface temperature, down-wellling and up-welling radiation to provide net radiative forcing from UV through IR, horizontal and vertical wind, and humidity.

       "    'abstract': 'The NASA/ESA-lead Mars rover ExoMars (launch in 2018) will carry a suite of instruments, one of the instruments is the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer MOMA. Organic material in the Martian soil will be either pyrolyzed at temperatures of up to 1000°C and separated by gas chromatography (GC) or volatilized by a UV-laser. A mass spectrometer (MS) will be the detector for both methods. The high temperatures during pyrolysis alters the organic molecules in the sample and creates smaller molecules suitable for the anylsis with the GC-MS. The analysis of terrestrial samples with pyrolysis-GC-MS is necessary to improve the ability to interprete the data from Martian samples. Extreme environments are a favored place to search for life forms similar to those expected on other planets. During the Arctic Mars Analog Svalbard Expedition 2011 gave access to several sample sites one was the Coletthödga.[1] Pyrolysis-GC-MS Analysis: The pyrolysis was conducted with a Pyrola 2000 connected to a Varian 3800 GC and a Varian 4000 ion trap MS. The sample was heated to 900°C within 15 ms and staid at that temperature for 2 s. The generated volatile compounds were directly injected into the GC. The GC-MS plots showed organic material strongly depending on the sample location. On top a layer of bioherm showed a evenly distributed patern of long chain hydrocarbon. In the sediment layer below only four long chain hydrocarbons are present. The hydrocarbon with 11 carbons is nearly absent, while the hydrocarbons with 10 and 12 carbons show large peaks in the GC-MS-plot.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'One of the most important tasks for preparation of a future manned mission to Mars is to create a space suit, which ensures efficient and safe operation of the man on the planet surface. The concept of space suit (SS) utilisation on the Mars surface will be determined mainly by the Mars mission scenario. Currently the preference is given to utilisation of robotics with the crew driving a Mars rover vehicle, whereby the suit will be used solely as an additional safety means. However, one cannot exclude the necessity of a durable self-contained stay of the man outside a pressurised compartment, to pick up, for instance, soil samples or do certain repair work in case of an emergency. The requirements to the Mars suit and especially to the personal self-contained life support system (LSS) will depend in many respects on the Mars environmental conditions, the space vehicle system concept and performance characteristics, the airlock and its interface design, the availability of expendable elements for the LSS, etc. The paper reviews principal problems, which have to be solved during development of the Martian suit. A special attention is paid to the issue of suited man mobility during traversing on the planet surface. The paper also reviews the arguments for application of a suit semi-rigid design concept and evaluates potentialities of using certain elements of the existing \"Orlan\" type suit. The paper presents results of a number of studies on selection of the planetary SS enclosure concept and on experimental evaluation of mobility of the lower torso and leg enclosures in conjunction with a specially designed prototype model (tentative model) of the SS enclosure.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Among several other projects, to enable a manned space mission to the Moon or Mars, the rovers that will be sent there, as precursors, need to have 3D environment mapping tools. Thanks to them, we will be able to choose the ideal location to build a viable habitat for the future missions. To perform a mapping, there are several techniques. These must be able to work in extreme conditions, like on the Moon in space, where there is no atmosphere or in more mild conditions like Martian atmosphere (7 mbar). In addition, they must not generate heavy digital data to be transmitted to Earth for analysis. Our choice fell on two known techniques, which are relatively quick to use and which comply with the recommendations listed above: LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and 3D stereophotogrammetry. The objective of our thesis was to compare these two 3D tools and to find a suitable mobile platform. This comparison was made by following a protocol that evaluated its techniques on their precision, their resolution and distance measurement compared to the same scene captured under the same initial conditions.First of all, the equipment used for the rover are quite simple but will provide a basic platform:Caterpillar type transmission. 2 DC Motors. 3,000 mAh battery. Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi3. Board extension for the actuators. Pan tilt. Camera sensor. There are three main programs for the rover\"s control.VNC Viewer for the remote control of the SBC. Python for the control of the actuator. Motion for the display of the video sensor. Then, we are going to explain what equipment we used to perform the tests. In order to create a LiDAR 3D scanner, we used:Sensor: TFmini from Benewake. 2 Servomotors (azimuth/elevation): type SG 90. Pan tilt. Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi 3B. Power supply: 20,000 mAh. Python: to create an algorithm. Software: Matlab (academic version), Meshlab (open source) and VNC viewer for remote control. Its resolution is 0.5° in azimuth and elevation. Once the mapping of the rover\"s surroundings is complete, the scanner saves a csv file with x, y, z coordinates with which we can generate a point cloud in Matlab (Fig.1) or Meshlab. Fig.1: A cave mapped by a lidar 3D scanner. Fig.2: A cave 3D reconstructed using stereophotogrammetry with MicMac software. For stereophotogrammetry, we used:Sensor: camera Fujifilm X-M1 (resolution 4896x3264, FoV: 83°, f=16mm) and webcam Logitech C920 HD Pro (resolution 1920x1080, FoV: 60°). Checkboard: needed for calibration, it is not mandatory but highly recommended for the accuracy. Software: Micmac (open source provided by French National Geographic Institute) or Matlab (academic version). Pictures (from 2 to 5) were taken with a random basis b (Fig.2). Furthermore, we needed to know the distance between the camera and a known point in the scene (yellow arrow Fig.2) and a distance between two known points on the scene (red arrow Fig.2) to make the comparison. We did the same protocol with the lidar 3D scanner.In order to have good results, we need to follow a protocol to obtain exploitable images for stereophotogrammetry. This protocol breaks down into different parts:Lighting: the light must be sufficient, constant, and uniform, that\"s why the use of flash is prohibited Camera settings: pictures must be made with constant parameters, allowing their sharpness, correct exposure, and sufficient definition. Lens: focal length must remain the same throughout the acquisition. White balance: fixed for all picture in the series. Sensitivity: as a rule, avoid going up in ISO. Aperture: choose an opening small enough for the entire object to be clear. Shutter speed: it should be adjusted to allow proper exposure. Save images: in RAW or JPEG (maximum quality) and disable automatic image rotation. Image processing: all images must be developed with the same parameters. Check the images before putting them on the platform and always delete those that are blurred. Never crop an image, sometimes this manipulation deletes exif data. In stereophotogrammetry, we faced one problem, only with the webcam that we used. The software needed some exif data about an image like the focal length used to capture it or the equivalent focal length assuming a 35mm film camera and the webcam did not put any information in the exif. We were able to solve this problem by making a calibration via Matlab software using a checkboard that provide us the intrinsic and extrinsic webcam parameters.Our progress led us to the following conclusions. First, the stereophotogrammetry is faster than LiDAR even including post processing. Without latency, you can obtain pictures very quickly while LiDAR needs at least 25 minutes with our algorithm to map the rover surroundings. The second point is that LiDAR can map more space from just one position while with stereophotogrammetry you need to move the rover in several points to improve the resolution and accuracy of your 3D reconstruction. That is an important issue because the rover\"s movements could be restricted.However, for best results we can merge the two point clouds from lidar and stereophotogrammetry to obtain the accuracy of lidar and the realism of stereophotogrammetry.The point of view of the rover camera is distorted by the lack of references of sizes and distances. One simple way to reduce this is to place a pattern in the visual field of the camera. That way the teleoperator will know if the rover can access difficult areas because he will see the future footprint of his rover. A more active way is to measure the range of targets by using Lidar. The restricted point of view of the operator can be compensate by multiple mobile cameras. In fact, multiple cameras can enhance greatly the comfort of the user. Larger field of vision of the user means less stress. Specific cameras can be used for operations (night vision, 360° recording). Installing multiple cameras is not limited to the user comfort, it can also be used by stereophotogrammetry. Indeed, we can add a camera with well-known parameters that will be able to map the field in real-time if we accept reduced information.'},\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Iron is one of the key elements in the evolution of the solar system and is highly abundant in terrestrial planets. Its oxidation state reflects the history of the oxidation reduction reactions on planetary surfaces. The identification of iron mineralogies and the relative abundance of iron oxidation states (2+ and 3+) will contribute to a much deeper understanding of the evolution of planetary bodies and their surfaces. Miniaturized Mössbauer spectrometers are under development primarily for missions to the planet Mars and the Moon, but there is also an interest on using such an instrument for space missions to the planet Venus, comets and asteroids. The instrument MIMOS II developed at TU Darmstadt meets the requirements for space application as low mass (about 500 g), small volume, and low power consumption (about 1 W). The instrument has been tested extensively in the laboratory but also recently in the field mounted on the robotic arm of a prototype Martian Rover under development at JPL/NASA, United States.',\n",

On the basis of sedimentological characteristics, the Murray formation has thus far been subdivided into 7 members. Here, we use chemical data from the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) to explore the relationship between the composition of the Glen Torridon region (current rover location where clay minerals have been identified from orbit) and the members of the Murray formation. <P />Many samples analyzed by the APXS have been infiltrated with late-stage Ca-sulfate precipitates, but when Ca and S are mathematically removed in a 1:1 molar ratio until either CaO or SO<SUB>3</SUB> reach 3 wt%, the bulk compositions of all Murray members and the Glen Torridon region are nearly identical within the standard deviation of the measurements. Minor differences include an apparent anti-correlation between SiO<SUB>2</SUB> and FeO<SUB>T</SUB> across the groups, and large average Zn values in the Glen Torridon unit. Given the differing mineralogies of the drill samples of the Murray formation established by the CheMin X-ray diffractometer (primarily in the nature and abundances of phyllosilicates and iron oxides/oxyhydroxides), alteration of a compositionally uniform precursor at low water to rock ratios is suggested. <P />K<SUB>2</SUB>O concentrations for the Glen Torridon region range between 0.5 and 1.4 wt% and are positively correlated with Si (correlation coefficient, R=0.8) and Ge (R=0.8) while negatively correlated with Mg (R=-0.9), Mn (R=-0.7), and possibly Zn. This strong relationship between K, Si, Ge, Mg and Mn found in Glen Torridon samples also exists in one other member of the Murray formation (Blunts Point member, 60-130 m lower in elevation) but is only weakly expressed or non-existent in the other members. This evidence indicates that the Glen Torridon region and at least the Blunts Point member of the Murray formation are geochemically connected, perhaps through a similar history of fluid interactions.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) is a well proven instrument for quantitative in situ elemental analysis of the planetary surfaces and has been successfully employed for Mars surface exploration. Chandrayaan-2, ISRO's second lunar mission having an Orbiter, Lander and Rover has provided an opportunity to explore the lunar surface with superior detectors such as Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) with energy resolution of about 150eV @ 5.9keV. The objective of the APXS instrument is to analyse several soil/rock samples along the rover traverse for the major elements with characteristic X-rays in 1 to 25keV range. The working principle of APXS involves measuring the intensity of characteristic X-rays emitted from the sample due to Alpha Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) and X-ray florescence (XRF) processes using suitable radioactive sources, allowing the determination of elements from Na to Br, spanning the energy range of 0.9 to 16keV. For this experiment ^{244}Cm radioactive source has been chosen which emits both Alpha particles (5.8MeV) and X-rays (14.1keV, 18keV). APXS uses six Alpha sources, each about 5mCi activity. Unlike Mars, lunar environment poses additional challenges due to the regolith and extreme surface temperature changes, to operate the APXS. Our APXS instrument consists of two packages namely APXS sensor head and APXS signal electronics. The sensor head assembly contains SDD, six alpha sources and front end electronic circuits such as preamplifier and shaper circuits and will be mounted on a robotic arm which on command brings the sensor head close to the lunar surface at a height of 35±10mm. SDD module to be used in the experiment has 30mm ^{2} active detector area with in-built peltier cooler and heat sink to maintain the detector at about -35°C. The detector is covered with 8 micron thick Be window which results in the low energy threshold of about 1keV. The size of the APXS sensor head is 70x70x70mm ^{3} (approx). APXS signal electronics consists of a PCB having digital, power and rover interface electronics circuits, which are housed inside the Warm Electronics Box (WEB) mounted under the rover chassis where the temperature is maintained between -50°C to +70°C. Presently, we have completed the design verification model of the APXS payload and engineering model of the payload is in progress. The developed system has been tested using laboratory X-ray sources and observed an energy resolution of about 150eV at 5.9keV when the detector is cooled to -35°C. We also carried out the detection of X-ray fluorescence for some of the USGS standards for a fixed geometry of detector, source and sample, using ^{55}Fe and ^{241}Am X-ray sources. It is shown that the count rate of a given peak varies linearly with the concentration of the corresponding element. The detailed developments and results will be discussed at the conference.\",\n",

Boron has been detected in Gale crater at levels &lt;0.05 wt % B by the NASA &lt;fi&gt;Curiosity&lt;/fi&gt; rover ChemCam instrument in calcium-sulfate-filled fractures, which formed in a late-stage groundwater circulating mainly in phyllosilicate-rich bedrock interpreted as lacustrine in origin. We consider two main groundwater-driven hypotheses to explain the presence of boron in the veins: leaching of borates out of bedrock or the redistribution of borate by dissolution of borate-bearing evaporite deposits. Our results suggest that an evaporation mechanism is most likely, implying that Gale groundwaters were mildly alkaline. On Earth, boron may be a necessary component for the origin of life; on Mars, its presence suggests that subsurface groundwater conditions could have supported prebiotic chemical reactions if organics were also present and provides additional support for the past habitability of Gale crater.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Acoustics has become extraterrestrial and Mars provides a new natural laboratory for testing sound propagation models compared to those ones on Earth. Owing to the unique combination of a microphone and two sound sources, the Ingenuity helicopter and the SuperCam laser-induced sparks, the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover payload enables the in situ characterization of unique sound propagation properties of the low-pressure CO<SUB>2</SUB>-dominated Mars atmosphere. In this study, we show that atmospheric turbulence is responsible for a large variability in the sound amplitudes from laser-induced sparks. This variability follows the diurnal pattern of turbulence. In addition, acoustic measurements acquired over one Martian year reveal a variation of the sound intensity by a factor of 1.8 from a constant source due to the seasonal cycle of pressure and temperature that significantly modifies the acoustic impedance and shock-wave formation. Finally, we show that the evolution of the Ingenuity tones and laser spark amplitudes with distance is consistent with one of the existing sound absorption models, which is a key parameter for numerical simulations applied to geophysical experiments on CO<SUB>2</SUB>-rich atmospheres. Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of sound propagation to interrogate the Mars environment and will therefore help in the design of future acoustic-based experiments for Mars or other planetary atmospheres such as Venus and Titan.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"A descriptive study of the near-surface meteorology at three of the potential Mars Exploration Rover (MER) landing sites (Terra Meridiani, Gusev Crater, and Melas Chasma) is presented using global and mesoscale models. The mesoscale model provides a detailed picture of meteorology on scales down to a few kilometers but is not well constrained by observations away from the Viking and Pathfinder landing sites. As such, care must be taken in the interpretation of the results, with there being high confidence that the types of circulations predicted will indeed occur and somewhat less in the quantitative precision of the predictions and the local-time phasing of predicted circulations. All three landing sites are in the tropics and are affected by Hadley circulation, by diurnal variations due to the global thermal tide, and by planetary scale topography (in these particular cases from Tharsis, Elysium, and the global topographic dichotomy boundary). Terra Meridiani is least affected by large variations in local topography. Mean winds at Terra Meridiani during MER landing would be less than 10 m/s with little vertical shear. However, these low wind speeds result from strong mixing in the early afternoon convective boundary layer, which creates its own hazard in the horizontal variation of vertical winds of up to 8 m/s (both upward and downward). In Gusev Crater the topography of Ma'adim Vallis and the crater rim generates strong diurnally reversing channeling of wind in Ma'adim Vallis and diurnally reversing radial flow in the crater associated with thermal slope winds on the crater rim. The overturning circulation in Gusev Crater slightly suppresses the daytime convective boundary layer. Melas Chasma in Valles Marineris provides an example of strong topographic forcing of near-surface circulation. Of particular interest is the channeling of regional scale wind toward the center of the Tharsis plateau during the evening. This results in a surface level jet along the canyon of over 25 m/s. Drainage of air from the plateau and into the canyon produces vertical winds down the canyon walls in the evening of over 5 m/s. In contrast, during the early afternoon (MER landing time), horizontal winds at the proposed MER landing site are relatively calm, with little mean shear with height. This results from the proposed site being in a region of local divergence and the action of daytime convection. The nature of flow in Melas Chasma results in an interesting dual maximum in boundary convection and depth, with the usual daytime afternoon free convective maximum being joined by a mechanically forced nighttime boundary layer of almost 2 km depth.\",\n",

Although alternative models deserve further scrutiny, the new radar image suggests the occurrence of episodic hydraulic flooding sedimentation that is interpreted to represent the basin infilling of Utopia Planitia during the Late Hesperian to Amazonian.

Recent innovations in low cost technology as well as trends in the entertainment industry have made stereoscopy popular among educators and audiences alike.

The overall finding is that the impact of stereoscopy on perceptions of scientific objects is limited when presented as static imagery. However, when presented as full motion films, a significantly positive impact was detected. To conclude, we present a set of stereoscopic design principles that can help design astronomical stereoscopic films that support deep and effective learning.

A wide variety of organic and biogenic molecular targets including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic amino acids, nucleic acids, photosynthetic pigments, and critical metabolic components such as flavin adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exhibit strong, distinctive fluorescent signatures following excitation by ultraviolet (UV) light sources. These fluorescence signatures are easily imaged with camera systems currently employed on Mars rovers and imaging equipment available during human or robotic exploration of remote extreme environments on Earth. In this paper we discuss recent results with epifluorescent imaging of organic and biological targets using filter bands comparable to those available to ExoMars and review plans for epifluorescence surveys of the Dry Valleys of Eastern Antarctica including the Schirmacher Oasis and the perennially ice-covered, merimictic, oligotrophic Lake Untersee.',\n",

A minor modification was also made which allows heights to go 'below' local terrain height and return 'realistic' pressure, density, and temperature, and not the surface values, as returned by the original Mars-GRAM. This feature will allow simulations of Mars rover paths which might go into local 'valley' areas which lie below the average height of the present, rather coarse-resolution, terrain height data used by Mars-GRAM. Sample input and output of both the interactive and batch versions of Mars-GRAM are presented.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs) are not instrumented to measure winds directly, but might be able to give insight into wind directions using other techniques. The Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) on the Instrument Deployment Device (IDD) on the Mars rover, Spirit, was used to remove dust and cut into a basaltic rock named Adirondack in Gusev crater on Sol 34 of mission operations. The rock abrasion operation occurred between about 1223 hr and 1518 hr in the afternoon (local solar time) and left a cavity 2.68 mm deep. An image taken after the abrasion operation showed that the rock cuttings were asymmetrically distributed around the cavity and over the rock in a direction suggesting that the cuttings were transported away from the cavity by winds. The distribution pattern (and the inferred wind) is being compared with results from wind tunnel simulations conducted prior to the mission to assess the wind-flow patterns as a function of rock, rover, and IDD positions with respect to the wind. The wind direction inferred from the RAT cuttings are also being compared with wind directions suggested by aeolian bedforms and albedo patterns seen from MER and from orbit, and with directions predicted by a model of the atmosphere for winds at mid-day in Gusev crater.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover is equipped to analyze both martian atmospheric gases and volatiles released by pyrolysis of solid surface materials, with target measurements including chemical and isotopic composition (Mahaffy et al., 2012). To facilitate assessment of instrument performance and validation of results obtained on Mars, SAM houses a calibration cell containing CO<SUB>2</SUB>, Ar, N<SUB>2</SUB>, Xe, and several fluorinated hydrocarbon compounds (Franz et al., 2014; Mahaffy et al., 2012). This report describes the first two experiments utilizing this calibration cell on Mars and gives results from analysis of data acquired with the SAM Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS). These data support the accuracy of isotope ratios obtained with the QMS (Conrad et al., 2016; Mahaffy et al., 2013) and provide ground-truth for reassessment of analytical constants required for atmospheric measurements, which were reported in previous contributions (Franz et al., 2015, 2014). The most significant implication of the QMS data involves reinterpretation of pre-launch contamination previously believed to affect only CO abundance measurements (Franz et al., 2015) to affect N<SUB>2</SUB> abundances, as well. The corresponding adjustment to the N<SUB>2</SUB> calibration constant presented here brings the atmospheric volume mixing ratios for Ar and N<SUB>2</SUB> retrieved by SAM into closer agreement with those reported by the Viking mission (Owen et al., 1977; Oyama and Berdahl, 1977).',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In situ measurements by the Curiosity rover provide a unique opportunity for studying the effects of dust on assets placed at the surface of Mars. Here we use in situ measurements of solar UV radiation to quantify the seasonal and interannual variability of dust accumulation on the sensor on the rover deck. We show that the amount of dust accumulated on the sensor follows a seasonal cycle, with net dust removal during the perihelion season until L<SUB>s</SUB> 300°, and net dust deposition until the end of the aphelion season (L<SUB>s</SUB> 300°-180°). We use independent in situ measurements of atmospheric opacity and pressure perturbations in combination with numerical modeling, showing that daytime convective vortices and nighttime winds are likely responsible for the seasonal dust cleaning, with the role of nighttime wind being more important in Martian Year (MY) 32 than in MY 33 and that of daytime convective vortices being more important in MY 33 than in MY 32. The fact that the UV sensor is cleaner in MY 33 than in MY 32 indicates that natural cleaning events make solar energy an excellent candidate to power extended (multiannual) Mars missions at similar latitudes as the Curiosity rover.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Reduced weathering rates due to the lack of liquid water and significantly greater typical surface ages should result in a higher density of meteorites on the surface of Mars compared to Earth. Several meteorites were identified among the rocks investigated during Opportunity's traverse across the sandy Meridiani plains. Heat Shield Rock is a IAB iron meteorite and has been officially recognized as ``Meridiani Planum.'' Barberton is olivine-rich and contains metallic Fe in the form of kamacite, suggesting a meteoritic origin. It is chemically most consistent with a mesosiderite silicate clast. Santa Catarina is a brecciated rock with a chemical and mineralogical composition similar to Barberton. Barberton, Santa Catarina, and cobbles adjacent to Santa Catarina may be part of a strewn field. Spirit observed two probable iron meteorites from its Winter Haven location in the Columbia Hills in Gusev Crater. Chondrites have not been identified to date, which may be a result of their lower strengths and probability to survive impact at current atmospheric pressures. Impact craters directly associated with Heat Shield Rock, Barberton, or Santa Catarina have not been observed, but such craters could have been erased by eolian-driven erosion.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Exposure to space radiation remains one of the major risks for human space exploration. Besides the ever-present Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), spontaneous Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) emitted from the Sun during Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) or solar flares, can dominate planetary and interplanetary radiation fields and increase the radiation dose by potentially orders of magnitudes. To better understand SEP propagation throughout the heliosphere and their radial and longitudinal dependencies, space weather monitoring at various location throughout the heliosphere is required. On the surface of Mars, the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) aboard NASA's Curiosity rover has been analyzing the radiation environment in Gale crater since 2012. Besides characterizing the radiation dose, RAD is also capable of measuring energy spectra and integral fluxes of charged and neutral particles. For the example of charged particles, RAD can distinguish between different ion species and for low-Z particles also between the different isotopes. RAD's location on the surface of Mars allows for unique space weather observations at 1.5 AU that are directly relevant to understanding particle propagation through the inner heliosphere, and the impact of space weather on future human explorers of the Red Planet. RAD's detailed measurements of SEP events, and other interesting observations, such as arrival times and duration of Forbush Decreases, CMEs, or the occurrence of Co-Rotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) provide valuable data for inter-comparison with measurements from other instrument at Earth and throughout the heliosphere. To contextualize the RAD SEP measurements, it is important to consider that Mars possesses an, albeit thin, atmosphere that can filter out lower-energy particles. Thus, protons need about 150 - 170 MeV to propagate through the atmosphere, reach the surface, and be detected by RAD. During the first nine years of its mission, RAD detected five moderate SEP events on the surface of Mars. As the solar cycle is now progressing towards the next solar maximum, strong SEP events are more likely to occur. Consequently, RAD has measured the two strongest events yet encountered, in the past four months. In this presentation, we will provide an overview of 10 years of SEP event observations on the surface of Mars with the RAD instrument. We will then focus on the last two strongest SEP events: the October 28, 2021 event where dose rates increased by a factor of 2.25; and the February 16, 2022 event where dose rates increased by a factor of 3.5 during the event.\",\n",

This paper presents the photogrammetric processing techniques for high accuracy topographic mapping and rover localization at the two landing sites. Detailed discussions about camera models, reference frames, interest point matching, automatic tie point selection, image network construction, incremental bundle adjustment, and topographic product generation are given. The developed rover localization method demonstrated the capability of correcting position errors caused by wheel slippages, azimuthal angle drift and other navigation errors. A comparison was also made between the bundle-adjusted rover traverse and the rover track imaged from the orbit. Mapping products including digital terrain models, orthophotos, and rover traverse maps have been generated for over two years of operations, and disseminated to scientists and engineers of the mission through a web-based GIS. The maps and localization information have been extensively used to support tactical operations and strategic planning of the mission.',\n",
